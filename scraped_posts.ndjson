After approximately 2\u20133 weeks, I was contacted by a Google recruiter via email. I requested 3 weeks of preparation time before the interview process began. However, due to a transition where my assigned recruiter resigned and a new one took over, the interview was delayed. I subsequently requested an additional 2 weeks to prepare for the phone screen.\n\nPhone Screen Interview\n\nThe problem involved reading strings from two files and finding the count of matching elements. After implementing the initial solution, the interviewer extended the problem to handle n files and asked for the maximum number of common elements found in at least two files.\n\nThe interview went well, and the recruiter later informed me that the interviewer gave a green flag to proceed to the onsite interviews.\n\nA new recruiter was assigned for coordinating the onsite rounds, and I requested around 3 weeks of preparation time.\n\nOnsite Interview\nRound 1\n\nThe task involved identifying duplicates within a 10-second window. I implemented a solution using a hashmap and discussed time and space complexity. The follow-up asked for optimizing space complexity, but I couldn't effectively articulate the improved approach \u2014 although I was aware it involved using a deque, similar to the Sliding Window Maximum pattern.\n\nSelf-Evaluation: Lean Hire / No Hire\n\nRound 2\n\nThis problem involved finding the farthest nodes from multiple source nodes using a breadth-first search. I implemented a BFS-based solution, and the follow-up questions were already addressed within my initial approach. I also discussed the time and space complexity in detail.\n\nSelf-Evaluation: Hire / Strong Hire\n\nRound 3\n\nThis round focused on common behavioral questions such as:\n\n\u201cWhat was your toughest challenge, and how did you overcome it?\u201d\n\n\u201cDescribe a situation where you had to work with a difficult teammate.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you handle a project that changed direction mid-way?\u201d\n\nSelf-Evaluation: Hire\n\nRound 4\n\nThe question involved using prefix sums and hashmaps to track specific indices. Although I initially identified the need for prefix sums within the first 10 minutes, I was unable to translate that insight into an efficient solution. I ended up proposing an O(N^3) brute-force approach and struggled to progress further.\n\nSelf Evaluation : No Hire\n\nFinal Feedback\n\nI received a call from the recruiter with the outcome. They summarized the feedback by stating I should focus on improving problem-solving and time efficiency a bit more."}

Don\u2019t rush into coding.\nClarify the Problem Statement\nAsk questions if anything feels ambiguous. Interviewers appreciate clarity over speed.\nThink Aloud\nWalk through your thought process. This shows your approach, even if you're stuck.\nBe Ready for Follow-Ups\nExpect the interviewer to probe your solution. Follow-ups often check if you can handle edge cases or optimize further\n\nEven \"easy\" problems can feel tricky under pressure\u2014what matters most is how you approach them. Don't worry about how fast someone else might solve it. Focus on being methodical, confident, and clear.\n\nIf anyone's curious, I\u2019m happy to discuss the approach I used or give tips on tree-based problems.\n\nResult :\nI was selected for next and final round.\n\nGood luck to everyone interviewing! \ud83d\ude80"}

The following interviews are in order chronologically, so I ended up speaking with a hiring manager before even the phone screen.\n\nTeam Match:\nI had ended up talking with a team immediately to see if there was interest, had a great conversation with a team and was told by the recruiter that other teams were also interested.\n\nPhone Screen:\n\nApparently did extremely well, recruiter couldn't provide any feedback on what to do better, besides just emulating that in the onsite round. I'm assuming SH here, there wasn't anything I could get from the recruiter for feedback, even when asking for mock rounds after this round.\n\nOnsite Round 1:\nWas my toughest round, was a backtracking problem mapping words in a dictionary to decipher the line. I figured out the approach but had trouble handling the coding due to time constraints, and various string manipulation needed for the code. I'd say LNH/LH as a result for this round, but could be a weak H as I finished the code and was very thorough in talking through edge cases, thought process, thought process in coding.\n\nOnsite Round 2:\nGoogliness round with the hiring manager I talked with at the Team Match. Seemed to go well, was able to use STAR for all the answers and the vibe seemed to be great by the end with questions. H or SH depending on the perception of my situations and the amount of independence they think i had.\n\nOnsite Round 3:\nAnother strong DS&A round. Was a question similar to https://leetcode.com/problems/buildings-with-an-ocean-view/ . I'm assuming H/SH based off of the very positive feedback from the interviewer.\n\nI'm pretty worried about potentially getting downlevel since Google is notorious of it.

It\u2019s been a full week now, and I haven\u2019t heard back from the recruiter. I know patience is key, but the uncertainty is starting to bug me a little \u2014 especially given how the round went.\n\nTotal time: 45 mins\n\nInterviewer joined 1 min late.\n\nThe question was to find a square of 1's in a binary matrix with some constraints.\n\nFirst I started explaining the DP approach[somewhat like Maximal area of 1's], but interviewer told to not use DP approach, due to a follow-up coming forward.\n\nI re-read the question and noticed 1 cue, and gave a brute force approach to find the desired square. Was asked to share time and space complexity and code the solution. I shared complexities and coded quickly.\n\nReached 15 min mark\n\nAfter being asked to optimize further, I re-read the question and notice another cue. I spent further 10-12 mins[took too long maybe :sad_emoji] thinking about the optimization, thinking out loud so as to show interviewer my logical thought process.\nI shared a relatively optimized approach. The approach worked fine in terms of logic and space/time and Interviewer asked to code the solution.\n\nReached 30 min mark\n\nI made 2\u20133 mistakes while coding[realised after the interview], which can be attributed to time constraint.\n\nLike, specifying wrong return data type in function signature, return wrong value[although correct value was calculated in helper function but forgot to update that value in driver function], mishandling 1 boundary condition.\n\nThese weren't conceptual errors \u2014 just the kind of minor things that come up when you're watching the clock and trying to wrap everything up cleanly.\n\nThe interviewer asked only one follow-up (nothing deep or layered), and seemed generally passive. At the end, I asked if he wants me to dry run the code on some example, \u2014 he said \"no\" since we're already reaching the time limit, but his tone felt a bit dry and seems like he was expecting to ask 1 more question/follow-up probably but due to time he couldn't ask.\n\nReached 42 min mark\n\nDiscussed team/work related questions. He enthusiastically explained me about his team and product and also vouched for company's great culture.\n\nReached 45 min mark\n\n*** Point to be noted,\nI didn't take any hint from the interviewer throughout the interview, even when I was stuck for sometime while finding the optimized solution, I logically approached to the optimal solution without any input from interviewer. [Just mentioning if it's counted as a plus]\n\nSo now I\u2019m sitting in this limbo, wondering:\n\nAre minor syntax/edge-case bugs like this considered forgivable if the core logic is solid?\n\nDoes lack of multiple follow-ups or a \"meh\" interviewer expression usually mean rejection?\n\nIs it common to wait 7+ days with no word from the recruiter?\n\nWould love to hear if anyone\u2019s had a similar experience. Was really hoping this would move forward, but trying to stay realistic too.\n\nThanks for reading. Please help me come out of this self doubt cycle \ud83d\ude4f"}

Here are the problems I got and how the interviews went\n\nDSA Interview #1\nI got an easy problem similar to https://leetcode.com/problems/logger-rate-limiter/ but with a couple of twists. I solved in like 20 minutes together with all the follow ups and the interviewer and I had a nice chat for the remaining time. It felt like this one was a strong hire\n\nDSA Interview #2\nFor the next interview there was a medium problem somewhat similar to https://leetcode.com/problems/pacific-atlantic-water-flow/\nI managed to solve it in around 40 minutes with DFS and DP with a couple of hints from the interviewer. I messed up time and space complexity slightly. Then there was a follow up which I explained that I would solve with BFS and set. The interviewer seems content with my answers overall and I assessed this as a hire or lean hire\n\nDSA Interview #3\nThis one was tough on me and hit my weakest spot - Trees. The problem was something close to https://leetcode.com/problems/find-leaves-of-binary-tree/\nI messed up this one pretty badly. Without explicitly being stated I assumed the tree as a binary one, which I realized after the interview. The initial version of the problem was a simple post-order DFS traversal and I coded it up in 10 minutes. Afterwards there was a follow up that I had absolutely no idea how to solve. The interviewer tried to throw in a bunch of hints, but I still didn't manage to progress at all since I was already too stressed and had a brain fog. After half an hour trying with all the help from the interviewer I just gave up. Honestly I have no idea about this one, sounds more like a lean not to hire\n\nGooglyness interview\nThis felt like a standard one. I just answered all the questions from my experience. I tried to pre-prep some answers, but didn't get the exact same questions unfortunately. Overall I estimate it as a lean hire or hire\n\nGuys who got to Google, would appreciate it if you could comment on whether I have any chance in this situation or not. Thanks"}

I had to fix it. It was related to unique_ptr and move semantics\nSome questions on memory managerment.\n\nFind Cousins of a node in a binary tree - I was able to propose 1 pass solution. Mix of pseudo and working code was required.\n\nThen the inteviewer asked to design an elevator system (more on the logic side rather than high level design) which is time efficient as well as energy efficient. I gathered the requirements. Wrote downt the use cases/scenarios. Explained them.\n\nThis round also went pretty well.\n\nRound 3 Manager(Techno Managerial) Feedback - positive:\n\nAsked about my projects a bit. Problems faced, how did you solve them, etc.\nThere were some C++ questions - regarding memory management, etc.\nAsked me one DSA question-\n\nCheck if a tree is a BST or not.\n\nThen there were C++ questions regarding singleton class.\nWrite a class where each object has a unique ID. Copying/assigning an abject should also lead to unique ID. Could not implement it fully.\n\nThis round went well apart from the last question.\n\nRound 4 Director(Techno Managerial):\n\nThe round was supposed to take place at 10 AM. The interviewer didn't join till 10:15. I called the recruiter, I was told that the interviewer won't be able to join. As I was leaving for office, I recieved a call that can you join now, interviewer is available. I joined at 10:35, the interviewer joined at 10:45 or 10:50.\n\nAfter that everything was in a rush. Asked about my projects a bit. Problems faced, how did you solve them, etc.\n\nThen asked the 3 priests and 3 devils puzzle. He just wanted the steps. Asked me to solve it and then \"just tell me the steps, don't tell me the result after every step\".\n\nThen he showed me a feature of the Illustrator software. Asked me to implement it. I was able to write something. I wasn't sure how much was it correct. The interviewer seemed a bit satisfied with my approach though.\n\nVerdict\n\nDidn't receive any feedback for a week. The recruiter kept on saying that she hasn't received any feedback. After one week I called again, the recruiter said that yout feedback is positive but the team has identified a candidate internally (WTAF). I was so pissed. The recruiter then said that she'll try to align me with some other team as my feedback had been positive. Only a 30 minutes director round would be needed more if she finds a team. It has been a week since then. She said that she doesn't have any updates as of yet and she'll update me when there is any change.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nAdobe made me go through 5-6 hours of interview process just to tell that although my feedback was positive but they have internally identified a candidate. The recruiter is trying to find some other team but hasn't received any update(I don't know how much truth is there to this but I'm now just waiting).\n\nToo much frustrated as this has happened to me twice now in a span of two weeks.

Given:\n\nclass Person {\n    String name;\n    int birthdayMonth;\n    int birthdayDayOfTheMonth;\n    Person parentA;\n    Person parentB;\n}\n\nI asked a lot of clarifying questions with some test cases\nFinalised on below approach\n\nfor every call fetch current system time\nget next birthday from current system time and return\nno rollback needed, need birthdays for current year only\nreturn Pair of day,month for alarm call\n\nI gave simple approach to traverse entire tree and get next immediate birthday from current date\nExplained that time taken will be O(n) for each alarm call\nInterviewer said it is fine and asked to code the solution\nI told may be we can optimise it further but he was keened on writing this approach first\n\nWrote the entire logic by creating a class and helper methods and comments, comparator was little tricky to write\nHe asked me to test my comparator\nThen gave one scenario where it will fail and then I fixed my method\nDiscussed time, space complexity including recursive stack space\n\nHe said it looks good\n\nFollow up question\nNow we wont rely on current system date\nFor every alarm call, trigger next birthday and subsequent call will come on that day\n\nProvided solution to maintain a min heap\nduring class initialisation build heap of all nodes with custom comparator(with constraints that tree will be fixed after initialisation)\nModified the above used comparator for min heap\nFor every alarm call, check if heap not empty return top element from heap and return\nProvided time complexity as O(n) for class, O(logn) for every alarm call\n\nAsked if he wants to dry run\nHe told me to dry run with above example which I had written for question 1\n\nThen he said it looks good and that was all from his end\n\nWhat do you think of the rating I will be getting in this round?"}

I was able to solve both problems in about 30 minutes, so she gave me another question similar to Asteroid Collision .\n\nRound 2 (Hard Level):\n\nThis round was conducted by a senior engineer and started off unexpectedly with questions from Operating System concepts. I was asked to explain topics like defragmentation, thrashing, and other memory management concepts, there were questions from virtual memory as well. The interviewer deep-dived into each concept. Then we moved into C++, where I was asked about the auto storage class, and to explain virtual functions with an example and describe their use case. After the theory part, I was given a dsa problem \u2014 a twisted version of the LRU Cache. I had to explain my logic and write pseudo-code.The interviewer went through it in detail and asked follow-up questions on each part of my implementation. Finally, I was given a problem similar to Reverse Nodes in K Group . We were short on time, so I explained my approach and wrote the pseudo-code.\n\nRound 3 (Medium Level):\n\nThe hiring manager started by asking how the previous rounds went and then transitioned into a resume-based discussion. I was asked to explain the projects I had worked on at my previous organization, the role I played, and how I contributed to runtime improvements through my code changes. The conversation then shifted to object-oriented design. I was asked to explain the Singleton class, how to ensure thread safety in its implementation, and to write the code for it.

We now need to design an algorithm that\nhelps identify the lowest price for the item at any point of the day.\n\nAssumptions:\n\nFor the algorithm, assume all vendors are selling the same product\nand there is only one product being sold. Given a list that has\nvendor information - ( startTime, endTime, price ) of the deal,\nreturn a sorted list with different possible intervals and\nthe least price of the product during the interval.\n\nThe interval is inclusive of start and end time.\n\nAll the 3 values passed by the vendor are integers.\n\nsampleInput = { new Interval( 1, 5, 20 ), new Interval( 3, 8, 15 ), new Interval( 7, 10, 8 ) };\nexpectedOutput = { new Interval( 1, 3, 20 ), new Interval( 3, 7, 15 ), new Interval(7,10,8)};\n\nI solved first question starting with brute force recursive approach and was able to pass all the test cases. Then I was telling optimized solution by memoization and bottom up tabulation but interviewer said brute force is fine and moved to 2nd Question.\nFor 2nd question I was not able to solved it completely interviewer was friendly and gave me hints after hints I was able to write code completely but was not able to run it as time was over.\nInterviewer was pushing me to write production level code eg. appropriate variable names, function names for eg. I used i, j for row , column for 1st question he asked me to change it to row, column.\n\nAfter 3 days I got email for Superday.\nMy superday had 3 rounds of 45 mins each.\n\nData Structures and Algorithms -> 2 Interviewers joined the call. Started with introduction. Then asked role specific questios like 1) How will you setup mongoDB cluster? 2) How will you configure your application for MongoDB using Springboot.\nDSA question asked was as follows :-\nList indicating a book. Each element in the list represents one page of the book. The page is space delimited.\nList Glossary word list\n\nOutput: Create a glossary for each word in the glossary list which indicates page\nnumbers where the word occurs.\n\nI was able to solve this question. Then as time was still left so they asked question what if you have huge data and limited CPU RAM how will your sort the data? -> I told merge sort and discussing on the same.\n\nResume Depth - Interviewer grilled on resume. I struggled to answer few questions like I worked on TOCTOU issue and for resolving this issue I used atomicOperation. Then interviewer went to underlying details of atomic operations how it works and how will you implement atomic operation function\nand then taking this question to hashMap about how will handle concurrnecy in hashMap? I was not able to answer this question thoroughly.\n\nDesign and Architecture round - > I was asked Design Rate Limiter.\nI was able to design but at the end while discussing about scalability I failed to answer one question which what will you if your redis cache is out of memory? I knew concept of data sharding but got blank not able to answer it properly.\n\nI got rejection email after 3 weeks."}

This community has been really useful in helping me prepare for the interview. So, I would like to give back to the community by putting my interview experience.\n\nThe overall process took close to 4 months starting from the application. The below questions are simplified from the actual question as I can\u2019t be disclosing the actual question.\n\nPhone Screen\nGiven a stream of float values, find the mean of last n values.\nFollow up - Given a value k, find the mean of last n values excluding k highest values from the n values.\n\nSolution - Solved it using a running sum for the first question. For the follow up I used a max heap along with the running sum to exclude k highest values every time we need to compute the mean.\n\nVerdict - Pass\n\nInterview 1\nA graph of movies is given where each movie also has a rating. Two movies are similar if they are connected in the graph. Task is given a movie, we need to find the top N similar movies with highest rating.\nFollow up - Movies are added dynamically and we need to do same task as above in between. How do you modify the code?\n\nSolution - Solved it with doing a BFS from the given movie, and using a min heap to track the top N movies found so far. I did not have very much time left to answer the follow up but suggested a DSU approach to keep track of similar movies and looping through all movies to find the top N movies using the same min heap approach and modified the existing code.\n\nVerdict - Lean Hire\nFeedback - There were some issues identified with testing and debugging. I think it was mostly due to the coding of follow up being incomplete.\n\nInterview 2\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/description/\nSame question is copy pasted along with the same test cases.\n\nSolution\nGave a sliding window solution where I keep track of frequencies of chars on the window. As I slide the window I will modify the frequencies and I will check the validity of window by comparing the frequencies with the string t.\n\nVerdict - Hire\nFeedback - Made a couple of implementation mistakes while coding, but I was able to correct some of them by doing dry run on my own. I think this lead to Hire instead of Lean Hire.\n\nInterview 3\nGiven two n-ary trees A and B where each node has a key K and a value V. We need to create a new tree following the below rules\nIf A just has node (K, V1), B just has node (K, V2), the new node will be (K, V2)\nIf nodes on A and B has same key, the merged node will have it\u2019s children also follow the same rule and the order should follow the order of A first and then followed by order of B.\n\nEx:\n\nA:\r\n  K1: U1\r\n  |-- K11: U11\r\n  |-- K12: U12\r\n  |-- K13: U13\r\n  K2: U2\r\nB:\r\n  K1: V1\r\n  |--K11: V11\r\n  |--K21: V21\r\n  |--K22: V22\r\n  K13: V13\r\n\r\nMerged Node\r\n  K1: V1\r\n  |--K11: V11\r\n  |--K12: U12\r\n  |--K13: U13\r\n  |--K21: V21\r\n  |--K22: V22\r\n  K2: U2\n\nSolution - Solved it using recursion and keeping a hash map of keys and values of B nodes\u2019 children at each call. We\u2019ll then loop through A nodes\u2019 children and construct merged nodes using recursion. If any child node key in A is not present on B, we can just add to merged node. Otherwise, merged node obtained from recursion is added. After all this, we can add remaining B\u2019s child nodes.\n\nVerdict - Strong Hire (Self Verdict)\nFeedback - I felt this was my best round, where I made a very minor mistake in base case, I was able to figure out some implementation mistakes on my own in the dry run.\n\nInterview 4 - Googlyness\nI was asked questions on my projects on my resume, and also tested in depth on some of the projects. Then some behaviourial questions are asked. If you follow the STAR pattern and answer the questions, that would suffice.\n\nCompensation Details - Link\nSimilar to this compensation posted by other user. I have ~4 years of experience and I felt the previous company\u2019s CTC details doesn\u2019t usually matter in deciding the CTC at Google.\n\nIf you have any doubts on any of the above questions, feel free to drop a comment and I would be happy to help."}

But eventually I come to know its from Google only and had an initial screening round in the first week of January and asked one month for the preparation time.\n\nPhone Screen Round:\n\nMy phone screen round was supposed to be happen in the last week of January but due to interviewer's unavailability my phone screen got rescheduled thrice !!\n\nSo it happened on 29th March.\n\nQuestion:\nMain problem:\nThere are two organisations (A and B), in org A, there are couple of servers connected by the cables through which data is being transferred and in org B there is a hacker who has hacked one of the server and that server got corrupted and From the corrupted node, the data transfer will not happen.\nNow your task is to find whether the data transfer will happen or not for given source and destination.\n\nI was able to solve this problem in 10-15 mins using BFS. Push all the server in queue if they are not corrupted.\n\nFollow Up 1:\nFind the shortest distance for data transfer from source to destination\n\nApproach: Initially I thought I need to use Dijkstra, and I started adding the edge weights to my graph, but interviewer interrupted me and said, consider they are unit weights.\n\nThen I removed priority_queue and kept queue because it will work in O(1) operation which I mentioned while removing the pq. Interviewer was happy that even while writing the code, I was thinking about the complexities.\nSolution : Modified the previous solution and introduced distance array.\n\nFollow Up 2:\nNow the corrupted server has ability to corrupt its adjacent neighbor servers till \"K\" distance. Now you need to tell whether the data transfer will happen or not and also compute the shortest distance.\n\nApproach: I implemented the multi source bfs and added all the corrupted servers into a set and while performing the BFS, Just check whether the server is present into that set or not, If its not present then we can push it into queue.\nRest of the code still remains same.\n\nVerdict:\n\nNext day my recruiter called me and said \"Your Feedback was very positive, will be moving your profile for onsites\"\n\nThen I asked my new recruiter to give me 1.5 months to prepare for the onsites because this was the first time I was appearing for Google L3 position and I don't wanted to make any mistake. And he agreed on that.\n\nOnsite 1:\nMain Question:\n\n(Interviewer was from US)\nhttps://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6552833/google-l3-onsite-round-1-2025-india-by-a-ndlg/\n\nThis was the exact same problem he asked me. The problem statement was very vague. So I was very confused so I asked so many clarifying question and after that I realised its a \"GRAPH PROBLEM\". So I explained my approach to the interviewer and he said \"Why to choose BFS or DFS\" I explained why I am more inclined towards BFS.\nHe agreed on that part and I coded the solution. And also explained correct time and space complexity and did dry run on two test cases.\n\nHe was impressed with the code quality and code-readability which he mentioned in the interview itself.\n\nFollow Up:\n\nNow find the number of stones you collected?\n\nApproach: Just added a counter and incremented in each BFS interation.\n\nInterview ended on a positive note\n\nOnsite 2:\nMain Question:\n\n(Interviewer was from Warsaw)\nYou are given the value n, and there will be an row on a board numbered from 0 to n-1. Now you are standing on the 0th position and you have two coins.\nNow you flip the coins at every position and based on the outcome you need to move forwared.\n-> Head, Head : You can move by +2 position\n-> Head, Tail : Can move by +1\n-> Tail, Head : Can move by +1\n-> Tail, Tail : Can move by +1\n\nFind out the number of ways you can reach the end position.\n\nApproach:\nI quickly realized its a DP problem. You can say a jump game variation.\n\nI explained my understanding about the problem to her and took some of the test cases for the output.\nI was thinking in Combinatorics direction.\nBut she said think in the recursive way or generating a recurrence formula.\n\nAND EVENTUALLY I LOST...\nShe given me some of the hints and I quickly catched it and while this was happening already 40 mins were completed and when I looked at the clock I got panicked because I did not even started to code.\nI asked her \"Can I write down the code?\"\nShe said : \"Yes\"\n\nI started writing the code in rush and due to that I made major mistake.\nEven after computing the correct recurrence relation. I wrote some different recursive calls.\n\nAnd at the end, Interviewer mentioned that I missed an edge case. I identified that and I added that\n\nBut I knew. I could have do"}

I have around 4\u20135 years of industry experience, and this post includes the types of questions I encountered, how I approached them, and what helped me prepare effectively.\n\n\ud83d\uddd3\ufe0f Interview Journey (Quick Recap)\nStarted with a recruiter call in January 2025 to discuss role expectations and background.\nHad four technical interviews throughout February, each testing different aspects of problem-solving and code clarity.\nAttended the Googliness (behavioral) round in March, focused on teamwork and decision-making.\nFinally, I had a team matching call in early May, and received the offer shortly after \ud83c\udf89\n\ud83d\udd01 Interview Questions I Faced\n\nHere are the kinds of problems I worked through during the process. The wording is paraphrased to avoid any policy concerns:\n\n1. Encode and Decode a Directed Graph\n\nI was asked to implement functionality to convert a directed graph (with int values and neighbor nodes) into a storable format and then reconstruct it.\nThis tested:\n\nGraph traversal (DFS/BFS)\nCycle handling\nMaintaining node identity across serialization\n2. Reach a Target Volume with N Jugs\n\nGiven multiple water jugs with different capacities, I had to determine whether it was possible to measure an exact amount using fill, empty, and pour operations.\n\nThis tested:\n\nModeling complex state transitions\nUsing BFS or DFS to explore all valid states\nAvoiding revisits using visited tracking\n3. Alice and Bob Reach a Destination with Minimum Combined Cost\n\nTwo individuals start from different nodes in a weighted graph. The goal was to find a destination such that the sum of their travel costs was minimized.\n\nThis involved:\n\nMulti-source shortest path logic\nCombining cost paths\nHandling disconnected components\n4. Merging Car Rental Intervals\n\nGiven a list of car rental bookings represented as time intervals, I was asked to merge overlapping bookings and return an optimized schedule.\n\nThis tested:\n\nSorting logic and boundary conditions\nClean iteration and merging\nEfficiency and correctness\n\ud83d\udcac Googliness & Behavioral Round\n\nThis round focused on qualities like communication, ownership, problem-solving mindset, and collaboration. I was asked about how I\u2019ve handled challenging scenarios, worked with teams, and contributed meaningfully beyond code.\n\n\u2705 Final Thoughts\n\nThe process was structured, challenging, and rewarding. Each interview tested a different aspect of engineering ability\u2014from problem solving and abstraction to communication and design thinking.\n\nIf you're preparing:\nBe consistent with your practice\nFocus on understanding patterns, not just solving problems\nReflect on your past experiences for behavioral questions\nPrioritize clarity in communication and clean coding habits\n\nGood luck to everyone preparing for interviews. Keep learning, and trust your progress \ud83d\udcaa"}

Gave the interviews mostly for experience, was not actively looking for a switch.\n\nThe leetcode community helped me in preparing, so sharing these details so that I could be of help to someone as well. :)\n\nTotal 5 interview rounds (including Phone screen)\n\nPhone Screen Round (DSA)\nQuestion. Given a list of strings like ['abc', 'bca', 'cab', 'xyz'], output the list of list of strings such that each group contains all the strings that can be rotated and converted to the other strings.\nFor example\n['abc', 'bca', 'cab'] will be part of one group.\n\nImplemented an almost brute force technique for this, used dictionary to store each new string as key, and value would be the list of all strings that have the same rotations. Evaluation focus was to have working implementation, explaining the time complexity and handling edge cases.\n\nResult - Cleared this round with the feedback that I need to focus more on the edge cases next time onwards.\nExpected Feedback - Hire\n\nDSA 1 - Given a storage where you can create sub parts to the storage, give the best order to delete the parts such that all the storages are deleted. A storage can be deleted if it has no children.\nExample\n{A : B, C}\n{B : C}\n{C}\n{D}\n\nOutput - [D, C, B, A] or [C, D, B, A]\nImplemented DFS based topological sort, nailed the implementation, interviewer was pretty impressed, and gave a follow up on this.\nIf you there are two options to delete, delete those together.\n\nAsked for implementation of this as well. Thought about it and figured out that implementing topological sort using BFS while maintaining 0 indegree nodes together should work, implemented the follow-up as well (not fully tested though), but got a very good feedback for this.\nExpected Feedback - Strong Hire\n\nDSA 2 - Given key value pairs of countries and countries you can teleport to. You need to reach from source to destination with the minimum cost using the teleporters. You are also given a set of broken teleporters so if you encounter these, you take 1 day to first fix the teleporter, and then teleport.\nExample -\nConnections:\n{0 : 1, 2, 3}\n{1 : 2, 5}\n{2 : 3, 4, 5}\n{3 : 4, 6}\n{5 : 6}\n\nbroken = {5}\nsource = 1\ndestination = 6\nExpected output = 0, because you can choose the path 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 6 with cost 0.\n\nCreated adjacency list with cost 0, and 1 (reaching anywhere from a broken teleporter), then tried to implement using bfs first, but realised I might need backtracking as well. Switched to implementing Dijkstra algorithm, even though I was getting distances to every node, instead of just the destination. Returned the cost to the destination node. Interviewer was pretty impressed looking at the correctness of the implementation, so asked me to add comments, explain time complexity, space complexity and seemed happy with the responses.\nExpected Feedback - Strong Hire\n\nGooglyness and Leadership Round\nWas asked questions of the format\n\nGive me an instance where you gave someone a harsh feedback but it helped in their growth.\nAn example where you went out of your way in your workplace.\nWhat are you planning to learn in the next one year?\n\nStrong communication skills and storytelling should definitely help here. It is alright if something never happened and you make up a story, but you should be able to deliver it as if it happened.\n\nThe interviewer gave away a bit of feedback by saying this - \"Do say hi if you plan to join google after these interviews\"\nExpected Feedback - Strong Hire\n\nML Domain Round\nThe interviewer made up a system design question on the fly based on the work that I have done before.\nGiven an email, a query, and user profile. Retrieve the relevant emails based on the query. The results should be ranked.\nFollow-up : Personalise the results based on user profile as well.\n\nThe discussions went well about the design and what are the possible approaches, dual embedder model using transformers, creating embeddings for email, as well as query. Cosine Similarity for getting the ranking. However, things went very wayvard once he asked me to code parts of the design. I went blank and didn't recall the details of how to create tensors, writing optimizers and all. Guess the interviewer got a fair bit of idea that usually ChatGPT is used for the coding part, and I'm only aware of the design side of things. :(\nThe follow-up questions didn't go too well as well, since I got anxious because I messed up the coding. Still shared enough views on designing the follow-up problem.\nExpected Feedback - Lean No Hire/ No Hire\n\nPreparation - Did 1 month of rigorous DSA prep, solved around 250 questions, medium and hard.\nFor ML round only went through theory and a bit of system design, I believe that turned out to be an issue in the end.\n\nHaven't yet received a response from the recruiter, not expecting anything positive to be honest.

I nailed this round(best of the lot). But then I was not getting clear feedbacks for a month, and today got the call from recruiter that I was rejected.\n\nLong story with timelines:\nDec 2024: I was reached out by the recruiter for L4 position. They said we will take 1 phone interview first.\n\nJan 2025: I have the phone interview which I cleared. Leetcode medium on heap. I was informed by the recruiter that it was onsite round 1 and not phone interview(lol).\n\nFeb 2025: I asked some time for other rounds for onsites. I gave 2 more technical rounds(both graph) and 1 behavioral. Overall feedback was positive with some level of negative feedback in one of the tech interviews. But since overall feedback was on the positive side, I moved ahead to team matching.\n\nFeb-Apr 2025: After the team matching round with 2nd team, I recieved positive feedback, and recruiter asked me documents and compensation details on mail. But then that position was filled by some other candidate. 2 more team matching round happened. In the last one again I received positive feedback, was asked all the documents and compensation expectations again. After some days, the recruiter told me that giving one more technical round will boost my profile. I was not over the moon on this, but I agreed. On 11th april I scheduled my interview(but no one came). Then I gave the round on 21st april, and nailed it(probably the most flawless round I have ever given). Luckily in my 4 rounds, in 3 of them I was asked graph questions which I had prepared really well.\n\nMay 2025: After 3 weeks, and few \"candidature still in progress\" replies, I started getting ghosted. I only sent 1 message per week asking for updates. For the last week I did not get any replies(ghosted). I called one of my previous recruiter from google(yeah google changes lot of recruiters in the process). I told him I just need clarity on what is the current status of my profile. Then today, as of 21st May, I recieved a call from my current recruiter, telling me about the rejection. Reason being overall technical feedback was lacking for them to move ahead with me(but how?). I asked and asked in different ways, but got the exact same line in reply.\n\nJust wrote this post so that if it happens with someone else, atleast they have something for relatibilty. If I can get to know if this happens and I am not alone that would be awesome. This drained a lot from me\n\nLeetcode Money:\nCurrent Company: UKG\nYOE: 4.5 Yrs\nComp: 22Base + 2 variable."}

I had to write code for two different approaches in this round which led to improper time management on my part.

The interviewer was very enthusiastic and collaborative. Once the question was given, I started with clarifying questions to ensure I understood the question. Some of my clarifying questions were appreciated by the interviewer as identifying the gaps in the question. I came up with an approach and interviewer was satisfied with the approach. I went ahead to coding, and then interviewer asked for dry run with multiple sample inputs. Within this discussion, I corrected some small bugs, and made the code more readable and improved the understandability of the code. I then realised that there is an optimisation possible which would greatly improve the complexity of my solution. I mentioned this to the interviewer, and he said while there is a more optimal approach, he is satisfied with my current approach. In this round, even though I did not code the most optimal approach, due to the highly collaborative and feedback driven round, my experience was positive,"}

The discussion went really great IMO.\n\nOne week later, I received the final offer letter !!\n\nPS: Hardwork always pays off.\n(Try solving the problem in round 4 by yourself, it is a good one)"}

Shortly after, I was scheduled for a screening round, which I cleared without any issues. A couple of weeks later, I was informed that I had passed the screening and was asked to provide availability for further interviews. I shared my slots, but received no response for the next two weeks. Then, after another few weeks of silence, they reached out again for more slots. I responded once more, only to be ghosted for about a month.\n\nBy late January, I followed up to understand what was happening. I was told they were still interested and asked to share availability again. This time, the interview was finally scheduled. I gave it my best and the Hiring Manager seemed genuinely impressed with my profile\u2014he even said HR would be in touch soon, which gave me some hope.\n\nHowever, after a week of silence, I reached out to HR and was told that feedback was still pending. I waited another two weeks, only to hear the same thing again. Finally, in late March, I was informed that the feedback was positive, but the role had already been filled. They mentioned another team might reach out if a relevant opportunity came up.\n\nA couple of weeks later, I was contacted again\u2014this time for an opportunity in GS. I explained my previous experience and shared my availability. After initially being unresponsive, the recruiter returned saying I would need to go through two more rounds for this new position. I agreed and gave them the earliest possible availability.\n\nWhen the interview invite came, I was surprised to see it was for an Analyst role focused on web development, whereas my background is primarily in backend development (Java, Spring Boot, Kafka). The interview preparation details were vague, so I reached out for clarification but received no response. On the day of the interview, I got an email saying they had tried to call me but couldn\u2019t reach me\u2014though I had no missed calls. I requested a quick virtual call, but again, no response.\n\nDespite all this, I attended the interviews and performed well. Two weeks later, I received a generic rejection email. I asked for feedback but haven\u2019t received a response yet.\n\nTo summarize, I went through over 8 rounds across more than 7 months, including multiple ghosting incidents, last-minute changes, and poor communication. I cleared the Associate-level interview and performed strongly in the Analyst round, only to be told I'm \u201cnot a fit,\u201d without any constructive feedback.\n\nIt\u2019s been a frustrating journey, and based on my experience, I would suggest others to manage their expectations from HR's when interviewing with this organization. Communication and professionalism\u2014especially from HR\u2014left a lot to be desired."}

Took some time to prepare and started interviewing in January.\n\nPhone Screen:\nSame questions as this. Was able to explain my solution (multi source BFS), estimate TC and SC, then write code. Did the same for the follow up.\n\nOnsite 1:\nGiven a file_path to chat logs, and a number K, return the K most talkative users (word count) from the logs. An example of the logs can be found here.\n\nAsked a lot of questions to understand edge cases, collision handling, etc., coz it seemed too simple. Found out i had to write the parser logic for the file. Also found out that in case of tie for the last position on top k list, we had to include all tied users in the result. Explained a heap solution, and wrote code for it. Was asked to write up different test scenarios for this problem.\n\nOnsite 2:\nYou are given a network of teleporters(nodes) (N - number of teleporters, edges - connections b/n teleporters). Some of them are broken. A broken teleporter/node cannot take you to another teleporter/node.\n\nQ1: Get the shortest path from A to B avoiding broken teleporters (expected output is list of nodes in travel sequence). If no path exists, return an empty list. I used BFS for this.\n\nQ2: Suppose the the broken teleporters are partially fixed. Travelling from a working teleporter is instantaneous. But teleporting from a fixed/partially working teleporter takes 1 day's time. Get the shortest path from A to B while minimizing use of partially fixed teleporters.\n\nMy first instinct was to use BFS with priority queue (Djikstra's). But interviewer mentioned there is a better approach. I realized the answer was a 0-1 BFS, and implelmented that.\n\nOnsite 3:\nBeautiful Path: You're given a footpath of n blocks, each painted with one of k colors. Guests walk along the path, and each has a favorite color c. The beauty of the path for a guest is the length of the longest contiguous footpath segment painted in their favorite color.\n\nQ1: Find the longest continuous streak of color c.\n\nUsed a simple iteration to solve this.\n\nQ2: Suppose we have many guests now, each with their own fav color. For each guest, return the max beauty based on their favorite color.\n\nUsed one map to track the maxBeauty for each guest. As we iterate over the blockColors, we keep track of curColor and curStreak for curColor. If the color is not curColor, we reset curColor and curStreak. If the color is curColor, we update curStreak. At each step, we check and store maxStreak for curColor.\n\nQ3: Let's go back to having 1 guest. Suppose you could repaint m blocks to any color. Find the max beauty value if we could repainit m blocks.\n\nUsed a sliding window approach, with the window limited by having not more than m non fav color blocks.\n\nFollow ups were likely to continue until we ran out of time.\n\nBehavioural Round: It was more of a conversation, so I don't remember the exact questions. But the conversations was fun and interactive.\n\nVerdict: Cleared all DSA rounds. My recruiter didnt share ratings for any interviews.\n\nOffer: https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6749999/google-l4-bengaluru-by-anonymous_user-deyh/\n\nThis was my 3rd interview with Google.\n\nMy DSA prep => Neetcode 150 + problmes from Google Interview Experiences from Leetcode (Google has a lot of repeated questions).\n\nWhat I have realized so far is that your code is just half of what interviewers are looking for. Here's the rest:\n\nAsk questions. You are an engineer. You are expected to ask relevant questions and get the full picture. Never expect the given problem to be the full problem.\nSpecify all the scenarios/edge cases that you are considering while building the solution.\nExplain your thought process while building/explaining the solution, like, why you think this is a sliding window/graph/binary search/whatever problem, what the algo are you planning to use, why did you chose BFS over DFS, etc. Justify the solutions/trade-offs/ decisions you make.\nBe verbal while coding, like, I am using a map here to save/track the maxBeautyValue for each guest, I am using this FOR loop to build my adjacency list, etc.\nUse clean and relevant variable names.\nCalculate TC and SC for your solution. They may ask this before you start coding as well.\n\nThe main point here is, BE COMMUNICATIVE. DO NOT TAKE LONG PAUSES. If you don't know the solution immediately, just communicate what angle you are looking at the problem from. If you realise that prespective was wrong, communicate that. The interviewer will give hints if you are taking too long, which is fine, but try not to take more than 1 hint, as that can push you towards a Lean Hire or worse.\n\nFinal TIP: Ask good/personal questions to all interviews at the end of the interview. This is your last chance to make a good impression on your interviewer. Don't ask generic questions like \"What is your tech stack?\". So prepare a list of questions that force the interviewer to put in some effort to answer (more l"}

If someone would ask me 1 year back why don\u2019t you try for Google, I would have said not possible. I am not that good at DS/Algo. I had solved 0 questions on leetcode a year back. I solved 200 Questions until my final interview and got selected. Sharing my experience and some tips here.\n\nI graduated from Engineering College Bikaner in 2015.\nIn July, I got an opportunity to interview at Google India. That\u2019s when I started preparing seriously.\nBefore that, I only had basic knowledge from solving simple problems and reading Code Monk articles on HackerEarth.\n\nMost of my preparation was done using three platforms:\n\nGeeksforGeeks \u2013 when I needed basic explanations.\nLeetcode \u2013 for practicing questions.\nHackerEarth \u2013 for reading up on data structure basics.\n\nI especially liked articles on HackerEarth about Heap, Union Find, and Dynamic Programming.\nFor any topic, I would first read the basics and common problems. Then I\u2019d switch to Leetcode to practice.\n\nI had 1 phone interview and 5 on-site interviews (4 Algorithm + 1 Behavioral). The on-site rounds were held over two days.\n\nResources I used:\n\nLeetcode, GeeksforGeeks, HackerEarth\nCracking the Coding Interview book \u2013 https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850\n\nFocus is very important.\nYou need a space where you can concentrate for at least an hour at a time.\nIn today\u2019s distracted world, focus was the key for me. Deep work matters. A few hours of focused work are better than sitting for hours without focus.\n\nFind out what time of day works best for you \u2014 morning or night.\nI used to study from 1 AM to 4 AM because there were no distractions.\nGive at least 1\u20132 hours per day (or 10\u201315 hours per week).\nPut your phone on silent and avoid social media.\nAs a beginner, if you\u2019re not giving at least 30 minutes of focused time per problem, you\u2019re not trying hard enough.\n\nHow many questions should you solve?\nAnswer: As many as it takes. Focus more on quality than quantity.\nIf you're starting from scratch, aim for 100 Leetcode questions. Cover different topics and difficulty levels.\nIf you\u2019re confident with some topics like DP or Graphs, reduce the number for those.\n\nI solved 200 Leetcode questions in total.\n\nEveryone's journey is different. Some solve 500+ questions and still don\u2019t make it.\nSome solve 300 and crack 20+ interviews. You have to find what works for you.\n\nLeetcode tips:\n\nPick one topic and stick with it.\n\nDon\u2019t switch topics before finishing.\n\nFollow the 3:6:1 ratio for Easy:Medium:Hard problems. Or 3:5:2.\n\nSort Easy questions by:\n\nAcceptance rate \u2013 shows the question is actually easy.\nFrequency \u2013 how often the question was asked in interviews (premium feature).\n\nProblem-solving strategy:\n\nUnderstand the problem fully. Think of input/output examples.\nThink aloud, write your approach on paper or whiteboard.\nKnow the time complexity before coding.\nEven if you get the solution right, check discussions for better approaches.\n\nTrack your progress:\nUse Google Sheets or any tool to record:\n\nQuestion link\nTopic and difficulty\nStart and end time\nWhether you passed all test cases\n\nThis helps build motivation and consistency.\n\nConsistency matters:\nIn running, cadence = steps per minute.\nIn coding, cadence = questions per day/week.\nEven with a job or college, aim for 2 problems/day or 14/week.\nIf weekdays are busy, cover more on weekends.\nIt will take sacrifices \u2014 less social media and fewer outings.\n\nIf you get stuck on a problem:\nIt doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not good enough. It just means there\u2019s something new to learn.\nDon\u2019t let your ego stop you from learning. Ask friends, read hints, check discussions.\n\nDon\u2019t spend more than 24 hours on a problem. If needed, look at hints or discussions.\nSpending too long on one problem will reduce your confidence and break consistency.\n\nLeetcode Premium helps in three ways:\n\nYou can filter questions by company tag.\nYou can sort questions by frequency (how often they were asked).\nAccess to Top 50 questions for each company \u2014 good for last-minute prep.\n\nCost is around \u20b912,000/year. Worth it if you're serious.\n\nDuring the interview:\n\nUnderstand the problem. Ask questions (e.g., can the array have negatives? Is the graph cyclic?).\nDon\u2019t assume anything. Clarify it.\nExplain your approach aloud. Think and talk.\nPractice on paper or whiteboard, not just the editor.\nOnce you and the interviewer agree on the approach, and you\u2019ve dry-run it, then write the code.\nIf time allows, discuss edge cases too."}

Return whether its possible to park every vehicle in those slots.\nAsked me about one of my projects in detail.\nAdvantages of using Springboot while design APIs.\nDependency injection. What is Singleton Bean. Design a class which acts like a Singleton bean.\n\nI stuttered a bit while explaining Dependency injection, other than that everything went well.\n\nRound 4: Software Engineering Practices\n\nYou're given an integer array. Write a program that shuffles the array in random fashion.\nThread and concurrency\nDesign Reddit\n\nI couldn't solve the DSA problem. Also I mentioned I had no experience in working with threads so she didn't porceed with the question.\nAlso struggled with the design problem but interviewer helped me through it. Asked me to write appropriate SQL queries along the way.\nI feel I messed up really bad in this round.\n\nRound 5: Software Design and Architecture\n\nDesign Bus ticket management system.\nPart 1: Different busses with routes and bus stops are mentioned. Design an optimal approach that will give us the number of options a passenger will have to chose a bus for one point to another.\nPart 2: Available tickets are also added to the problem. As bus moves from one stop to another, available tickets keep changing. How to design such a scenario.\nDesign Google docs(in the form of an array), with features like snapshot. Should be space optimized to the fullest. I gave her 2 semi optimal approaches, but we couldn't discuss further as time was up.\n\nThis round was also good imo, I could answer almost all the queries. Could be better if there was more time.\n\nVerdict: Rejected\nI did not recieve any mail or call from recruiter post this. In application portal it shows 'Application Turndown', so I guess this is it."}

But it wasn't until March '25 when we had that \"next\" call.\n\nI was briefed about the interview process that there will be 5 rounds. 1 Phone Screen (elimination) and 3 technical rounds + 1 Googlyness rounds. The technical and Googlyness rounds had a cumulative feedback.\n\nNote: I asked for a interview time after 7PM IST so all of my interviewers were based in the US timezone.\n\nRound 0 (Phone screen):\n\nI was asked to design an content server and had to implement 2 APIs:\n\ngetContent()\naddContent(contentContent, contentScore)\n\ngetContent() should return content and reduce its score by 1. Also, we cannot return back the same content twice.\n\nThe statement was pretty vague so I had to do some back and forth to gather the requirement and build upon it, but I was able to do so and the interviewer seemed satisfied.\n\nA week later, I received a callback that I have cleared the Phone screen round and another recruiter will be reaching out to me (this took another 15-20 days).\n\nRound 1 (Technical round 1):\n\nA matrix was given which represented an ocean with cells having values as 0 and 1, 0 indicating that it's water and 1 indicating that it's a land or a part of some island.\n\nIf a cell (or a group of cells) having a 0 value was surrounded by a land cell (1) on all sides, then it was considered a fresh water lake.\n\nThe input was the coordinates of a land cell and I had to tell the number of fresh water lakes that island had.\n\nFor example, consider the following matrix:\n\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n0 [0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0]\n1 [0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0]\n2 [0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1]\n3 [0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0]\n4 [0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0]\n5 [0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0]\n\nLet's say the input is given as {1, 2}, then the island has only 1 lake. But if the input is {2, 7} then the island has two lakes i.e. one with the cells {2, 7} + {2, 8} and another with the cell {4, 7}. Note that I asked the interviewer and then got to know that the land cells can be connected in 8 directions (up, up-right, right, right-down, down, down-left, left, left-up) but the water cells are only connected in four directions (up, right, down, left) - that is the reason why cell {1, 9} is not connected to the lake and why cell {0,5} is connected to the island.\n\nI tried building upon a solution initially using brute force and failed but I soon implemented a solution quickly:\n\nPreprocess the matrix and mark all the ocean cells using multi source BFS or DFS - this will leave out the fresh water lake cells as it is.\nStart a BFS from the given island cell and every time we hit a fresh water cell, start another BFS for that cell to ensure we've covered the complete lake.\na. The number of times we run BFS for the fresh water cell is going to be the answer as it will be equal to the number of lakes in that island.\n\nThe interviewer said that this is not the most optimal solution but it's acceptable. I am probably a little confused as I do not think there can be a better solution than this - I tried searching for this but couldn't find anything better. Anyway, moving onto next round.\n\nRound 2 (Technical round 2):\n\nI was given a log file sorted by time and every log line contains a marathon runner and a checkpoint they have reached. I had to return the order of checkpoints as they can appear. It was also given that a runner can choose to stop or not stop at a particular checkpoint.\n\nThe question was just the above part and I came to a agreement with my interviewer that after some processing I can assume a pair of runner ID and a checkpoint tag for each line. For example:\n\n{1, b}\n{2, c}\n{1, c}\n{2, a}\n{1, f}\n\nUsing the above information, I deduced that each runner will reach their checkpoints in order anyway. So I concluded:\n\n1 --> {b, c, f}\n2 --> {c, a}\n\nAfter this, I flunked and gave only the brute force solution of finding each checkpoint's position but 2 days after the interview I realised that all that was left for me to do was implement topological sort here to get the final answer as b, c, f, a or b, c, a, f.\n\nNote that if we have contention between two checkpoints or their order is not clear from the given information, we can assume them in any order. See above example for reference with a and f.\n\nRound 3 (Technical round 3):\n\nI was expecting this to be a DSA round but this turned out to be more like a design round.\n\nI had to design a library which can check whether a given function (which only takes in boolean parameter(s)) is a good or bad function. There was a condition given according to which we had to evaluate if it was good or bad.\n\nFor completeness, I would mention that the given condition was such that the if the function evaluates to true for either a positive or negative value of the passed parameter, then it is a good function.\n\nWe discussed the tradeoffs and my choices why I went for a certain way and implemented feedback whenever the interviewer tried"}

I initially solved it using DFS and then explained the BFS approach, covering the time complexities of both. I was able to code both solutions within the allotted time. The recruiter later informed me that the interviewer was very happy with my performance and specifically appreciated the quality and style of my code.\n\nRound 2:\nThis round focused on an interval problem. I successfully implemented the main solution and then tackled two follow-up questions, coding those as well. With five minutes remaining, I was asked an additional follow-up involving float values in intervals. Due to the time constraint, I couldn\u2019t come up with a solution right away. However, the interviewer mentioned that he was happy with my performance and praised my code quality, comments, and naming conventions. He also said he believed I could have solved the last part with a bit more time.\n\nRound 3 (Android Round):\nI was asked to design a file reader app that works on a button press and displays a progress bar. Follow-up requirements included allowing the user to cancel the file reading process and writing test cases for the same. I implemented the solution using Kotlin coroutines, Flow, MVVM architecture, and followed all standard Android and Kotlin development practices. The feedback was very positive\u2014both the interviewer and the recruiter praised the technical depth and quality of my solution.\n\nFinal (Googliness) Round:\nThis round included standard behavioral questions such as, \"When did you go beyond your responsibilities?\" and \"Have you mentored others?\" I followed the STAR format while answering and shared examples that included both challenges and positive outcomes. I did not receive specific feedback for this round, but I believe I was able to articulate my experiences effectively."}

One thing to know about Google interviews: they often keep questions vague on purpose. Not to confuse you, but to observe how well you communicate, how you break down problems, and how deeply you think.\n\n\ud83d\udccc Golden Rule for Google Interviews:\n\nRead the problem multiple times.\nAsk clarifying questions.\nDon\u2019t rush into coding.\nThey want clean, well-thought-out solutions \u2014 not quick fixes.\n\nMy telephonic round had two tree-based questions:\n\nOne was centered on Inorder Traversal.\nThe other seemed like a follow-up, but turned out to be completely independent \u2014 testing if I could recognize the difference and push back if needed.\nI proposed alternate and optimized solutions to both \u2014 and that helped me stand out.\n\nA week later, I got a call from HR: I passed! They asked for my availability for onsite interviews \u2014 five potential days. I agreed. My interviews were scheduled on four consecutive days, which was incredibly stressful.\n\nIn the week leading up, I was grinding hard on everything I ever struggled with:\nKMP, Convex Hull, Segment Trees, and more. I was mentally exhausted, constantly questioning if I\u2019d even make it.\n\nOnsite Round 1\n\nA two-pointer problem with precomputation, related to subarray sums.\n\nOnsite Round 2\n\nA recursive tree problem involving contiguous and isolated identical values.\n\nOnsite Round 3\n\nThe interviewer didn\u2019t show up, so it got postponed a week.\nWhen it finally happened, it was a stack-based question involving bracket matching and equation simplification.\n\nGoogliness Round\n\nFocused on behavioral aspects \u2014 leadership, pressure handling, communication, and ethics.\n\nAll these rounds, back to back, were mentally draining. I had panic attacks. At one point, I was literally crying and breathless during the interview, but somehow \u2014 I held it together.\n\nI cleared 3 out of 4 rounds. The one I missed? The one where anxiety truly got the best of me.\n\nStill, HR told me that passing 2 was enough, and I\u2019d done really well \u2014 so they pushed me forward. I went through team matching and everything was going well... until it wasn\u2019t.\n\nHiring Committee backed out , probably concerned about the one failed round, scheduled 2 more DSA interviews to be safe \ud83d\ude43.\n\nThen began a 2-month delay full of reschedules and uncertainty.\n\nOnsite Round 4\n\nAn array-based problem involving greedy strategy, prefix sums, and hashmap balancing.\nIt felt like solving a complex necklace arrangement problem \u2014 but the question was poorly worded, and the test cases were brutal. I was on the edge the whole time.\n\nOnsite Round 5\n\nThankfully, this was a Leetcode contest problem I\u2019d solved 2 months ago and was daily problem a week ago \ud83d\ude09. The follow-up was the same, but seeing me solve quickly, the interviewer got suspicious and gave me a third follow-up.\nLuckily, I had my heap, two-pointer, and binary search strategies ready \u2014 and nailed it.\n\nAfter those two final rounds, I felt hopeful but also scared.\nWhat if they think I cheated?\nWhat if they drop me now?\nI had worked too hard and come too far.\n\nBut the truth is \u2014 the real game is in how you communicate.\nHow you shape the problem, how you ask the right questions, how you structure your thoughts.\n\nThere were moments I was running out of time, but because my approach was solid and I picked the right data structures, I was given a pass.\n\nA week later, HR called:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all positive! \u2026But your matched team has moved on.\u201d\n\nBack to team-matching \u2014 again.\n\nTwo more weeks.

One of my favorite musicians passed away, my mental health took a major hit, and in the middle of all that, I got the email. Google HR reached out saying they wanted to interview me. No referral. Just me, constantly applying and praying my resume made it to the top of the pile. (Tip: BOLD the important stuff in your resume \u2014 HRs don\u2019t have time, and first impressions matter!)\n\nBut I wasn\u2019t in the best place. Emotionally drained, full of anxiety, I couldn\u2019t even process it properly. And guess what? I got kicked out right after HR screening \u2014 turns out, my current tech stack didn\u2019t align with their needs. Then... the HR ghosted me.\n\nI was devastated. Thought I got put on a cool-down period. Helpless, I started reaching out to everyone I could. Sent tons of connection requests, begged for referrals. Only one person responded \u2014 based purely on my LeetCode profile. That meant the world. I\u2019ve spent over 3 years grinding here, and it finally counted.\n\nStill job-hunting, still doubting myself, I got another email from a different Google HR. Same message. A new chance. Meanwhile, I\u2019d already failed over 10 interviews \u2014 Juspay, NammaYatri, Amazon, Goldman Sachs, and more. I realized I lacked in development skills \u2014 I had given everything to DSA.\n\nBut this time, I was ready. My failures taught me how to speak. How to express. This was my second shot at a better life.\n\nMy current job wasn\u2019t helping either. Office politics were the worst. My manager kept exploiting my work, taking credit, and during my yearly feedback, had the nerve to say I\u2019m useless without him.\n\nBut guess what?\n\nIn the next post, I\u2019ll break down all my interview rounds and in the last one \u2014 my salary negotiation and final result.\n\nSpoilers: I\u2019M IN.

I was pretty confident, I recapped almost everything: Binary Trees, BSTs, Graphs, DP, Greedy, even Math&Geometry, and I learned a little bit about Tries: a concept not well-known to me.\nI was expecting to get maybe like a medium-hard DP or something related to Graphs, but destiny said I should get Tries. Was I unlucky to get this kind of question? Or it's just my fault for not preparing very well on this one topic?\n\nI have done the brute force approach, maybe with some minor bugs (because of the emotions). Then I started to describe how a Prefix Trie would help us and then wrote a solution for that. Only after the interview I realized I made some mistakes afterwards, on some base case conditions (it was a recursive solution), but the main steps of the algorithm are there and there was not enough time left. For sure I'm gonna get rejected for this, but at least I expect them to appreciate the thought process.\n\nQuestion:\nYou are given a pattern consisting of alpha characters and [] (square brackets). Anything outside of [] is literal, anything inside [] are alternatives (pick exactly one). Return all strings from a list of strings that match a given pattern. The pattern changes for every call, the list of strings stays the same and can be preprocessed.\nExample:\npattern: \"tele[op]ho[bnm]e\"\nlist: [\"cat\", \"dog\", \"telephone\", \"telephonepole\", \"tele\", \"telehoe\", \"teleophobnme\"]\nresult: [\"telephone\"]\n\nWhat do you think about this problem?

It's been over 2 months, and I've heard nothing. I tried reaching the recruiter (a Careernet CW), but they didn\u2019t respond.

The interviewer wasn\u2019t interested in the brute-force approach, and I struggled to come up with an optimized solution. In the end, both of us ended up frustrated.\n\nOnsite 2 (Day 16):\n\nI waited for 20 minutes, but the panel didn\u2019t join.

About 15 minutes before the end, I figured out the right algorithm (two min heap approach) and coded it (ofc, with one bug - I just had to swap the pair elements so that the priority queue would work based on the first element). The interviewer mentioned it was a hard problem to solve and implement optimally in time. I pointed out the bug, but she said it was okay and that she understood.\n\nFeedback (Day 50):\n\nAfter three weeks of silence, I had already joined another company. The interviewer mentioned that the overall feedback wasn\u2019t up to the mark. I didn\u2019t ask for individual round ratings. She asked if I would be open to considering L3 roles, I declined and said I would aim for L5 next year.\n\nTips\n\nFor L3/L4 roles, there's no need to prepare for System Design. If you have time, just go through previously asked LeetCode questions in sorted order. Interestingly, the question I was asked in the first round turned out to be a fairly common one.\nhttps://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6520235/google-phone-screening-by-anonymous_user-d9l9/\nhttps://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6157196/google-l4-interview-experience-verdict-r-fsw0/ q2 from screening"}

The format was straightforward: a 45-minute technical interview conducted over Google Meet, where I collaborated with the interviewer via a shared document to implement a solution.\n\nOne important learning from my past interviews was not to jump into coding immediately. This time, I spent a solid 20 minutes discussing multiple approaches, validating edge cases, and aligning expectations with the interviewer before writing any code. That initial discussion helped establish a shared understanding of the problem and potential solutions.\n\nProblem Statement\n\nYou're working at a restaurant with a single waitlist for party assignments. You need to implement the following operations:\n\nAddWaitlist(partySize): Adds a party to the waitlist.\nRemoveWaitlist(partySize): Removes a party from the waitlist.\nFindParty(numSeats): Returns the earliest party from the waitlist whose size fits the given number of seats. Returns -1 if no suitable party is found.\nMy Approach\n\nI explored using a queue and a hash map initially ( discarded it because of duplicate partySizes and should have throughly explored this one ), but ultimately chose a linked list (with phoneNumber as unique id) to handle potential duplicate party sizes in the waitlist. This led to an O(n) solution for both finding and removing a party.\n\nAfter I read the O(1) solution using HashMap and Queues, I was sort of dissapointed because I felt like I almost had it, but chose linkedlist to implement in the intrest of time.\n\nWhat Went Well\nIdentified and walked through edge cases thoroughly.\nPerformed dry runs to validate the logic.\nConfirmed method contracts with the interviewer\u2014for example, agreeing to return -1 when no suitable party was found.\nWhat I Learned\n\nClarify expectations early. I missed the opportunity to ask whether returning the next nearest table size was acceptable if an exact match wasn't found. Understanding such nuances can significantly influence the design of your solution.\n\nWhile I felt Google was always something unachieavable for me. I came accross this quote of Nietzsche which said \"I know of no better aim of life than that of perishing, animae magnae prodigus, in pursuit of the great and the impossible.\""}

The time that I took for Google interviews, I tried to solve 4/5 problem daily on medium/hard level on leetcode, gfg along with taking leetcode contest regularly. I used needcode roadmap to make sure that I am solving problem from different category. Created my own sheet with the problems. FYI, I used needcode roadmap just for reference so that topics are covered.\n\nI followed multiple channels on youtube for understanding different concepts (Mostly they are quite popular on youtube). Some were really helpful and some were just copy paste of editorial.\n\nTip: Take as much help as you can from youtube and online resources, don't stick to one sheet (Your goal should be to learn and understand fundamentals rather than focusing on one interview)\n\nTip: Try solving needcode roadmap problems after having good understanding of fundamental concepts. Treat this as quick revision for any interview\n\nCreate your own sheet and keep track of time you take to solve\nYour goal should not be just get AC on leetcode but think through the problem.\ne.g. https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/description/ This problem has multiple solution. Like using basic brute force (which will throw TLE) but using multiset (leetcode will AC). However, if you dig deep you can find the better solution using deque.\nMost interviewers have this expectation that you should gradually build up solution and pin point the bottlenecks to improve upon your solution\nSystem Design\n\nPreparing for this was a bit tricky. There are not enough structed resources are available for free. I started with some youtube channels on system design. First, let me provide the resources that I used to prepare for system design.\n\nBasic Concepts : Gaurav Sen : System Design Primer \u2b50\ufe0f: How to start with distributed systems?\n\nLeveling up : System Design Interview: An Insider's Guide \u2013 Volume 1 and Volume 2 by Alex Xu (you can find free pdf version on github)\n\nI would recommend buying this book as they are really good for leveling up and preparing for interiew\n\nAlex Xu's books have some shortcoming as well. While going through the different system design aspect it talks about some choices which is not covered in details.\n\nTip: Dig deep into these concepts instead of memorizing for a particular problems. For e.g. It has described some locking methods for payment gateways which lacks depth. I would recommend to explore those topics if you have time.\n\nAdvance Concepts : Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann\n\nThis book has details on how to handle distributed system which requires processing of large amount of data\n\nLLD : System design interviews are generally focus on HLD, however I have seen some companies asking LLD as well.\n\nI followed Christopher Okhravi - Head First Design patterns (its available on youtube) while I was actually learning different design pattern\n\nTips:\n\nTry making small notes about new terminologies that you are coming across while going through the books. This will later on help you with revisions and to recall on why and where this was being used or should be used.\nThere are 1000s of resources online, try to find the one which you find interesting.\nGoogle Interview\n\nEach round takes around 45mins, some of my round was extended to 60mins as well due to interviewers interest in follow up questions\n\nRound 1 : DSA\n\nProblem Statement\nGiven a single string which has space separated sorted numbers, determine whether a specific target number is present in the string.\n\nE.g. Input: \"1 23 34 123 453\" Target: 123\nOutput: true\n\nTip: always ask follow up questions\n\nThis looks a straight forward problem of binary search but the way it should be implemented can be based on your follow up questions else you end up with solution which may not cover a"}

You have sufficient storage space to place items off to the side while you wait for a full triplet that all fit together.\n\nConveyor belt items are floating point numbers. Three items that \"fit together\" means that all items are within distance d of each other. Once a 3 tuple is formed, those items must be discarded (should not be considered for future tuples).\n\ninput_stream = [1.0, 11.0, 12.0, 13.0, 2.0, 3.0]\nd = 3\n\nOutput:\n[[11.0, 12.0, 13.0], [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]]\n\nDistance is calculated by absolute values of the items for example\n|1.0-2.0| = 1 <= 3\n|2.0 - 3.0| = 1 <= 3\n|1.0-3.0| = 2 <= 3\n\nInput will not be given as an array but instead is a stream of numbers. The question is the same as here. Look at user foraccode's reply for the code. I gave the same solution but instead of using an array, used a binary search tree.\n\nFollow Up\n\nIf instead of just floating point numbers, you were given points on an X-Y plane, how would you modify the solution?\n\nRound 1\nQuestion 1\n\nGiven a node in a Binary Search Tree (BST), find the next largest (inorder successor) and next smallest (inorder predecessor) node. It is guaranteed that these nodes always exist (i.e the input node will never be the smallest or largest node in the BST).\n\nYou are only given a pointer to the node, and each node has a parent pointer.\n\nThe structure is as follows:\n\nstruct Node {\r\n    int value;\r\n    Node* left_child;\r\n    Node* right_child;\r\n    Node* parent;\r\n};\n\nConsider this BST:\n\n        4\r\n       / \\\r\n      2   6\r\n     / \\ / \\\r\n    1  3 5  7\n\nIf the given node is 3, the next largest (successor) is 4, the next smallest (predecessor) is 2.\n\nTo find the next largest (successor), we must consider 2 cases:\n\nNode has a right child - In this case, the successor is the leftmost node in the right subtree.\n\nNode has no right child - In this case, move up to the parent until the current node is a left child. That parent is the successor.\n\nSimilarly, for the next smallest (predecessor), just flip the above logic:\n\nNode has a left child - The predecessor is the rightmost node in the left subtree.\n\nNode has no left child - Move up to the parent until the current node is a right child. That parent is the predecessor.\n\ndef find_successor(node):\r\n    if node.right_child:\r\n        curr = node.right_child\r\n        while curr.left_child:\r\n            curr = curr.left_child\r\n        return curr\r\n    else:\r\n        while node.parent and node != node.parent.left_child:\r\n            node = node.parent\r\n        return node.parent\r\n\r\ndef find_predecessor(node):\r\n    if node.left_child:\r\n        curr = node.left_child\r\n        while curr.right_child:\r\n            curr = curr.right_child\r\n        return curr\r\n    else:\r\n        while node.parent and node != node.parent.right_child:\r\n            node = node.parent\r\n        return node.parent\nQuestion 2\n\nGiven a source, destination and corrupted node, find if it is possible to reach the destination from the source.\n\nThis is a straightforward BFS / DFS question. Just don't traverse the corrupted node.\n\nFollow Up\n\nReturn the minimum distance of every node from the source node. The edge weights can all be considered as 1.\n\nSince I had used BFS to solve the question initially, I just modified it to store the distances as well (Since all edge weights are the same, we don't need to use Djikstra).\n\nRound 2\n\nThis was a Googliness round. We went over my resume and general questions were asked. You can search up these questions quite easily on Google, Leetcode and YouTube. It was just a general discussion.\n\nRound 3\nQuestion 1\n\nGiven 2 strings, return if they are buddies. 2 strings are buddies if the distance between each char of the strings is the same. dist('a', 'b') = 1 and dist('b', 'a') = 25. Also, dist('z', 'a') = 1.\n\nThis was an extremely easy question. I was honestly surprised.\n\ndef are_buddies(a: str, b: str) -> bool:\r\n    if len(a) != len(b):\r\n        return False\r\n\r\n    # Compute the circular distance between characters\r\n    diff = (ord(a[0]) - ord(b[0])) % 26\r\n\r\n    for i in range(len(a)):\r\n        if (ord(a[i]) - ord(b[i])) % 26 != diff:\r\n            return False\r\n\r\n    return True\nFollow Up\n\nGiven a list of strings, group all buddies together.\n\nThis can be solved in O(NK) where N is the number of words and K is the average length of the word. The idea is to generate a hashable signature for each word based on the relative character distances.

I followed up again on February 20, still nothing. Then out of nowhere, on April 3, I got an invite for an IPS (Initial Phone Screen) call scheduled for today (April 16).

But just an hour before the call, I received an email saying the event was \"cancelled\"\u2014no reason given, no explanation. I immediately replied asking why and if it could be rescheduled. The calendar invite wasn\u2019t completely removed, just updated with \"cancelled event\" in the title. So, I still joined the meeting, hoping it was a mistake and she might still show up. Even though I was working from the office, I managed to step out just to attend this call.\n\nA similar thing happened with Meta. I applied for a role that said \"Remote from anywhere in the world\" and got a phone screen invite in the middle of the night. I joined the call fully prepared, but no one showed up. Later, I found out the recruiter had assumed I was based in the US, but the role was only open to US candidates.\n\nRight now, I\u2019m feeling hopeless and questioning myself and my skills.

I quickly switched to my phone's hotspot and reconnected.\nI had not seen the Q that he had presented me with, but he changed that Q and I was then given the below problems to solve.\n\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string/description/\n\nGave the optimised approach directly, as I had already lost some time due to the power cut. Then he asked me to code it.\nThere were some Qs around the approach as I was using C++ and perhaps the interviewer had more experience in Java. But I clarified all the doubts he had regarding the data structures I used.\n\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/description/\n\nIt was a variation with snow getting filled between the hills. You can find the Q at multiple places on the internet.\n\nI gave the brute force approach first, then optimised it using max height arrays and coded the solution.\nOnce the solution worked correctly, I slided in the fact that the problem can be solved using two pointers in a more optimised way.\nSeemed like the interviewer was not expecting it and since there was still 10-12 mins left, he asked me to code that approach as well. Which I was able to complete just in time.\n\n\nAfter almost 2 months of waiting and thinking that the position might have already been filled by some other candidate, I out of the blue received the call from the recruiter for the next rounds and the super day was scheduled 2 days later.\n\n\n\n3.

Then I was able to code it pretty quickly.\n\nCreate a \"Set\" Data Structure with min. memory consumption.\nThis was an interesting Q and revolved around math operations like mod, left shift, right shift, etc.\nThe idea was to not use complete bytes to store the value in the array but to divide the bytes into bits and use each bit as a storage unit.\n\nRound 2 - Technical (DSA + LLD)\n\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/partition-equal-subset-sum/description/\n\nLLD - Design a food delivery application\n\nThe round went pretty smooth, I was able to solve both the problems.\n\nRound 3 - Technical (DSA + LLD)\n\nYou have written \"Design Principles\" in your resume. Could you tell us about what design principles you have used in your projects?\nI had not revised design principles in months!! And there were cross questions on everything I was saying. It didn't go well.\n\nThen he asked me to design the classes and functions (LLD) for a timesheet entry application. A tool that employees use in an organisation to put in their daily working hours.\n(The Q was detailed with multiple features he was interested in, but I don't remember all the details.)\nI even struggled in this Q.\nWith just 10 mins remaining and I not anywhere near the complete solution, they decided to skip it and move to the next Q.\n\nGiven the rth row and cth column of the pascal's triangle. Return the value at that position of the triangle.\nThe interviewer wanted me to come up with the recursive solution. He specifically mentioned that there is a formula for this but he doesn't want me to use that.\nI solved the problem in just under 3 mins (with code).\n\nReceived a call from the recruiter that the result of the last round was not good. It was a mix. Therefore, they would like to retake the round.\n\nRound 4 (Round 3 again) - Technical (DSA + HLD)\n\nI was presented with a long 8-10 lines of problem statement along with multiple enums, classes, methods and test-cases already written. I was supposed to complete the one empty method present in the program.\n\nAfter a 15-20 mins discussion around the problem statement and clarifying all my doubts, the problem came down to something similar as https://leetcode.com/problems/optimal-account-balancing/description/ ( or Minimising the no. of transaction in splitwise).\nIt was a variation in terms of transactions of buying and selling of assets.\n\nI immediately told them the approach using 2 priority queues and explained how it would work. They asked me to code it.\nSince a lot of the time had passed in clarifying the problem statement and I was on the right track with my approach, they stopped me half way through the code stating that they were satisfied and would like to move to the 2nd part of the interview."}

I gave two interviews , each lasting for almost 1.5 hrs.\n\nFor frontend, I was given option whether I'd like react or angular questions and since I've been working on react lately, I opted for it.\n\nThe question was given a dataset of employees which have attributes as id, name, department and reportees which is a list of employees again, implement a file structure kind of system where on clicking one employee you must see it's data and reportees.\n\nDid a basic working implementation of the same using functional components. Dont focus much on styling or css.\n\nFollow up question to this was what if any employee has no reportees? Make sure to handle edge cases carefully.\n\nProvided a working solution with all edge cases handled.\n\nSecond round was on same day for Java. Same coderpad setup which was for frontend round too to code.\n\nQuestion was given an array of words determine which words are anagrams and return them\n\nex. I/P : [\"bat\", \"tab\", \"eat\", \"tea\"]\nO/P: [[\"bat\",\"tab\"],[\"eat\",\"tea\"]]\n\nDid a brute force method approach first, then with a few hints optimized it by using hashmap where key is the word and value is 26 length integer of 1s and 0s representing the count of alphabets with a delimiter like # after count of every alphabet.\n\nMissed out on edge case handling of blank sting in input. Couldn't complete an executable code. Interviewer also deep dived into time and space complexities of the appraoches and asked working of hashmap, what happens when there is collision, deep dived into red black trees and its concept.\n\nFinal verdict: Rejected, no feedback, just an auto generated email saying thanks(wtf?) Feeling really dejected"}

Let me explain the wrong understanding you guys having:\n\nSuppose i is the index which you decided to donate. The you are assuming that you will check the prefix[0, i-1] and suffix[i+1, n-1].\n\nNow this approach won't work and is wrong. Because even after donating the index i element, there can be possibility that split index is not i. This is clear even in my example testcase.\n\nNow when using donations index is not valid.

Now the api method can also handle multiple commits at the same time parallely to get the pass and fail for all of them. I thought about it. and came with a better solution that we can use the binarySearch on the subRange as well, We will try to find the failure point for mid subRange if that gives the failure try to look for smaller subRange on left side subRange else go to higher number subRange.\nTime Complexity -> O(logK*logM)\n\nNow he asked me K will be also dependent and could be N if M = 1. Which our machine could not handle again.\n\nI thought for a sec and told him we could get the min Failure point for each subRange using the given API method which could make\nTime Complexity : O(logK)\n\nIn the end, I couldn't anything else and I felt He was not satisfied. I am not sure what would be the best approach for this scenario, can anyone tell me is it even possible to do it in better way.\n\nand what do you think what are my chances, will he give me atleast a Lean Hire or not.

Each field in the grid is either empty (denoted by a dot\".\") or contains an uppercase English letter. Each particular letter may appear at most twice in the grid.\n\nYour task is to reconstruct string S by visiting fields of the grid. You start the reconstruction with an empty string. You can choose the field in which you want to start. In one move you can change the current field to an adjacent one (up, down, left, right). If you visit a field containing a letter, you may append this letter to the end of the reconstructed string. Appending a letter is not counted as a move. Each field can be visited and each letter can be used multiple times during the reconstruction process.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of moves needed to reconstruct string s?\n\nWrite a function that, given a string S and an array grid, returns the minimum number of moves needed to reconstruct S. If it is not possible to reconstruct S, return -1.\n\nExamples:\n\n1.\u2060 \u2060Given S = \"ABCA\" and grid = [\".A.C\", \".B..\",\".. \"...A\"], the function should return 6.\n\nThe optimal movement during the reconstruction process is as follows:\n\nstart on the field containing \"A\" in the first row;\n\ngo to the adjacent field with \"B\" in one move;\n\ngo to the field containing \"C\" in three moves;\n\nreturn to the starting field with \"A\" in two moves.\n\nThis way, the string \"ABCA\" Is reconstructed in six moves.\n\nGiven S = \"KLLRML\" and grid = [\"K\", \"S...L\",\"R\", \"LX...\", \"XM..S\"], the function should return 13.\n\nThe optimal movement during the reconstruction process is as follows:\n\nstart on the field containing \"K\";\n\ngo to the field with \"L\" on the right side of the grid in five moves - note that while being on this field, two consecutive letters \"L\" can be appended to your string:\n\ngather letters \"R\" and then \"M\" in six moves;\n\ngo to the closest field containing letter \"L\" in two moves.\n\nGiven S = \"XZZY\" and grid = [\".Z.\", \"XBB\", \"..A\"], the function should return -1. It is impossible to reconstruct S because letter \"Y\" does not appear on the grid.\n\nI have attached google drive link for the images of the question."}

The HR representative explained the job profile, collected details on relevant experience, and scheduled the upcoming interviews.\n\nRound 1 and Round 2 were technical interviews focused on data structures, algorithms, and core computer science concepts.\n\nRound 3 was a managerial round, which involved both technical deep-dives and project-related discussions.\n\nRound 4 was the Director's round and interviewer was a senior manager, where both technical knowledge and career motivations were evaluated.\n\nEach round progressively increased in depth and complexity and each one was elimination round. After clearing all rounds, a final confirmation call was made by HR informing the selection for the role.\n\nInterview Questions:\n\nRound 1: Technical Round I\nThe interviewer asked detailed questions about the projects from my previous organization. A DSA question was asked on finding the length of the longest substring without repeating characters using the sliding window technique, followed by printing either the first or last such substring. Questions were also asked from DBMS (ACID properties, locks, indexing), Operating Systems (deadlocks, multithreading), and Distributed Systems (load balancing).\nDuration: 1 hour\n\nRound 2: Technical Round II\nI was asked to find the diameter of a binary tree, including the class construction. There were also conceptual questions on pass-by-reference and how it works in Java and C++.\nDuration: 40 minutes\n\nRound 3: Managerial Round\nThe interviewer asked the Next Greater Element question along with a detailed dry run. This was followed by in-depth questions on my ongoing project, its requirements, and the optimizations implemented. Topics such as multithreading in Java and C++, JavaScript\u2019s async/await behavior, and how JS handles asynchronous operations in a single-threaded environment were covered. The producer-consumer problem and its solutions were discussed, along with questions on REST APIs, HTTPS requests, API design, and API contracts. The round concluded with a system design question on designing a lift system.\nDuration: 70 minutes\n\nRound 4: Director's Round\nThe discussion started with questions about my prior experience and reasons for switching jobs. Two DSA questions were asked: KMP Algorithm and Kadane\u2019s Algorithm, both of which required complete code implementation.\nDuration: 1 hour"}

There are 4 rounds for me. 3 technical and 1 Googleyness.\n\nRound-1: Expected Result: Lean Hire\nProblem-1: Set Difference of Floating-Point Ranges\n\nYou are given two lists of floating-point ranges, a and b. Each list contains zero or more disjoint ranges, represented as pairs [start, end), where start is inclusive and end is exclusive. The ranges within each list are not necessarily sorted.\n\nYour task is to compute the \"set difference\" of these ranges, specifically a - b. This means you need to find all the segments within the ranges of a that do not overlap with any range in b.\n\nThe result should be returned as a list of disjoint ranges, also in the [start, end) format, preferably sorted by their start value.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\na = [[2.5, 7.5]]\nb = [[4.3, 9.3]]\nOutput: [[2.5, 4.3]]\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\na = [[2.5, 7.5], [9.0, 10.4]]\nb = [[4.3, 9.3], [9.5, 11.0]]\nOutput: [[2.5, 4.3], [9.3, 9.5]]\n\nProblem 2: Nth License Plate Generator\nAn office issues license plates following a specific sequence composed of six distinct patterns concatenated together:\nRange 1: 5 digits (00000 to 99999)\nRange 2: 1 letter followed by 4 digits (A0000 to Z9999)\nRange 3: 2 letters followed by 3 digits (AA000 to ZZ999)\nRange 4: 3 letters followed by 2 digits (AAA00 to ZZZ99)\nRange 5: 4 letters followed by 1 digit (AAAA0 to ZZZZ9)\nRange 6: 5 letters (AAAAA to ZZZZZ)\nThe sequence starts with 00000, then 00001, ..., up to 99999, immediately followed by A0000, A0001, ..., Z9999, then AA000, and so on, until ZZZZZ. Note that this is not a simple base-36 conversion; the number of letters and digits is fixed within each range (e.g., 12CD5 is invalid).\n\nWrite a function getNthLicensePlate(n) that takes a 0-indexed integer n and returns the nth license plate in this sequence as a string.\n\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 0\nOutput: \"00000\"\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 1\nOutput: \"00001\"\n\nExample 3:\nInput: n = 99999\nOutput: \"99999\" (Last plate of Range 1)\n\nExample 4:\nInput: n = 100000\nOutput: \"A0000\" (First plate of Range 2)\nRound-2: Expected Result: Lean Hire\nProblem: Find Undirected Cycle in Directed Graph \n\nYou are given a directed graph represented by its number of nodes n (labeled from 0 to n-1) and an adjacency list adj.\n\nYour task is to determine if there is a cycle in the graph when considering its edges as undirected. That is, for every directed edge u -> v present in the input, you should treat it as an undirected edge u -- v for the purpose of cycle detection.\n\nIf such an undirected cycle exists, return a list of integers representing the nodes in one such cycle. The path should start and end with the same node, and list the nodes in the order they are visited in the cycle. The specific starting node or the direction of traversal (clockwise/counter-clockwise) does not matter, any valid cycle is acceptable.\n\nIf no such undirected cycle exists in the graph, return an empty list.\n\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 4, adj = [[1], [2], [0], []] (Edges: 0->1, 1->2, 2->0)\nOutput: [0, 1, 2, 0] (or [1, 2, 0, 1], etc.)\nExplanation: Treating edges as undirected (0--1, 1--2, 2--0), the cycle 0-1-2-0 exists.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 4, adj = [[1], [2], [3], []] (Edges: 0->1, 1->2, 2->3)\nOutput: []\nExplanation: Treating edges as undirected (0--1, 1--2, 2--3), the graph forms a line (path), which is acyclic.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: n = 5, adj = [[1, 2], [3], [], [4], [1]] (Edges: 0->1, 0->2, 1->3, 3->4, 4->1)\nOutput: [1, 3, 4, 1]\nExplanation: Treating edges as undirected (0--1, 0--2, 1--3, 3--4, 4--1), the cycle 1-3-4-1 exists. Note that node 2 is connected but not part of this cycle.\n\nExample 4:\nInput: n = 3, adj = [[], [0], [1]] (Edges: 1->0, 2->1)\nOutput: []\nExplanation: Undirected edges are 1--0 and 2--1. This forms the path 0--1--2, which has no cycles.\nRound-3: Expected Result: Strong Hire\nTitle: Simplify Algebraic Expression With Parentheses\n\nYou are given a string formula representing a mathematical expression. The expression consists of:\n\nLowercase English letters ('a' through 'z') representing variables.\nAddition ('+') and subtraction ('-') operators.\nParentheses ('(' and ')').\nEach variable implicitly has a coefficient of 1. Your task is to simplify the given formula by removing all parentheses and combining like terms, producing an equivalent expression.\n\nThe resulting expression should follow these rules:\n\nTerms should be ordered alphabetically by variable name.\nEach variable should appear at most once.\nCoefficients of 1 should be omitted (e.g., a instead of 1a).\nCoefficients of -1 should be represented only by the minus sign (e.g., -b instead of -1b).\nTerms should be joined by + or - signs as appropriate. Do not include a leading + sign.\nIf the simplified expression evaluates to zero (all terms cancel out), return \"0\".\nInput:\n\nformula: A string representing the algebraic expression.\nOutput:\n\nA string representing the simplified algebraic expression according to the rules ab"}

The interviewer joined in and seemed distracted, so I went ahead and introduced myself and they stopped in middle to ask me \"I though you're from [FAANG] currently. I clarified that I used to work there and have been at new place for about 2 years now.\n\nThe interviewer seemed to believe at the point that I shared the incorrect Resume deliberately which I clarified that I was asked for my Resume and gave latest one, I had no idea how they got such an old Resume (Even recruiter clarified that it was latest).\n\nFollowing that, intervier did not even introduce themself and just pasted they question and said \"Solve this\", then went back to do something else and again seemed distracted.\n\nThis was the question: Google Onsite\n\nAt first I started explaining on how we traverse for finding cycle, and in a similar fashion dfs would help us print the ring and was interuppted to say, \"No, its not to find a cycle but to print ring aren't you seeing the question\". All subsequest attempt at discussion of my thinking process was met with some berating comment but I still kept my calm and did my best.\n\nBelow was the code I did.\n\n  private static List<String> findRing(Map<String, List<String>> graph) {\n    String node = graph.keySet().iterator().next();\n    List<String> result = dfs(graph, node, null, node);\n    return result;\n  }\n  \n   private static List<String> dfs(Map<String, List<String>> graph, String node, String prev, String startingNode) {\n     if(node == startingNode && startingNode != prev && prev != null) {\n       return new ArrayList<>();\n     }\n     \n     for(String next : graph.get(node)) {\n       if(next != prev) {\n          List<String> list = dfs(graph, next, node, startingNode);\n         // Visit only once\n          if(list != null) {\n            list.add(node);\n             return list;\n          }\n\n       }\n     }\n     return null;\n   } \n}\n\nOn this part I was told multiple times \"Make it look better\", \"Do something to make it better\" and honestly felt I was talking to ChatGPT \ud83e\udd72\n\nI explained on this part as much as I could, but was told to improve this approach so could not discuss any other approaches (like BFS, which would be even better here)\n\nThen after a few days I got my feedback that I got \"Neutral\" feedback and interviewer mentioned that I missed a lot of edge cases and did not properly debug the code so don't move forward. This was so disheartening since the code I had even on dry run had no bugs (even confirmed during interview), and I covered all edge cases! To top that, I got a 12-month cool-off.\n\nI explained to recruiter that it might have a little bias since interviewer believed I shared wrong resume intentionally, and the feedback does not seem to what actually happened. We could either get the feedback once again or since it a neutral feedback we could go for atleast 1 more round to decide, apart from that the 12 month was alot for neutral feedback since I already have 5 years experience and was really prepared for interviews (I prepared for Google for over a month). Recruiter said nothing could be done and just share feedback over mail.\n\nHas anyone else faced this on Google interviews? Is it common to happen or did I miss anything?"}

Here are my questions:\n\nIs this wait time normal? Has anyone else experienced a month+ delay in team matching for L4 at Google?\nWhat can I do to move things along? Should I reach out to my recruiter with something specific (e.g., teams I\u2019m interested in), or is there another way to nudge the process?\nExploring teams myself: Would it make sense to network internally or signal interest in specific teams, and if so, how do I go about it?\nWhen to pivot? How long is reasonable to wait before I start seriously looking at other opportunities?\n\nAny advice, shared experiences, or tips would be hugely appreciated. I\u2019m feeling stuck and could use some guidance to either speed this up or decide what\u2019s next. Thanks so much!\n\nTags: #Google #TeamMatching #L4 #HiringProcess #CareerAdvice"}

An initial resume screen is performed by the recruiters and then final shorlist is done by Managers who look for good overlap in technical skills of the candidate and skills required for the role.\nSo it's really important to tailor the resume to the Job description for Apple.\n\nApplied to about 10+ roles on the Apple Careers site, whose description overlapped with my experience.\n\nRecruiter Call\n\nAbout a month later, a recruiter reached out regarding one of the roles. This was for a Full Stack Engineer on an internal ML platform.\nShared my experience and was able to move ahead for a Hiring Manager Round.\n\nHiring Manager\n\nA very candid discussion on why I chose the role, my relevant experience, why I would like to join, where I see myself, and why I chose Apple.\nThe conversation was very positive, and I knew I was moving to the next round\n\nTechnical rounds have a general similarity.\nThe problems were highly vague. They required me to ask the right questions to complete the problem definition and then start working on it.\nThey were very keen on clear communication and discussions.\n\nTechnical Phone Screen\n\nProblem 1: A vote counter\nStarted with this vague problem statement and narrowed it down to this -\nBuild a class to read millions of votes from a ballot list and perform rank-based vote counting. Had to handle batching to solve for memory usage.\n\nProblem 2: Given a Binary tree of 0's and 1's where the left node is the same as the parent and the right node is opposite to the parent, determine the value of the n'th node at l'th level.\nI sketched out a sample tree and then proceeded to use recursion to arrive at the solution.\n\nOnsite - 5 rounds\nCoding 1\n\nProblem: Given a set of characters, determine all English words that can be created.\nStarted the discussion on determining the inputs and outputs, the structure of the dictionary to validate against.\nBuilt a trie with the dictionary list and tested every permutation of the characters.\nOptimised it in a second approach by generating a HashSet for every anagram in the dictionary and checking against characters.\n\nSystem Design\n\nThis was not a generic design round at all.\nThe interviewer was a very experienced person who had worked with Apple for over 10 years.\nThe round focused primarily on my experience. He picked each of my experiences and we discussed very deeply about my entire task. Why I picked it, what I did (sketched multiple diagrams for each question), how I measured performance, what I would do differently today.\n\nBehavioral\n\nThis round was with a senior manager.\nQuestion: Given the values of Apple, such as Deep expertise and Drive for Excellence, how have you showcased these in your career?\nI started picking examples from my first job to my last job, highlighting the different lessons I had learnt - technical, cultural, and leadership.\n\nSome key lessons I highlighted were -\n\nKeeping it simple (KISS).\nDon't jump to solutioning too soon.\nRespect everyone's expertise.\nResolving conflicts.\nMotivating team members.\nCoding 2\n\n**Problem 1: **Given a dataset, sample n items while maintaining the original probability distribution.\nVery straightforward problem, the solution was to maintain the original counts and use random to sample.\n\n**Problem 2: **Create a React component that can display 1M records.\nThe problem required slicing the data and displaying only records that would fit within the scroll section.\nThis is a classic React interview problem.\nPractice Resource : https://www.greatfrontend.com/interviews/dashboard\nHad practiced questions from here which made this really easy to solve.\n\nCoding 3\n\nDiscussed my expertise in React. Then the interviewer drew a basic input UI and asked me to implement it.\nI showcased skills such as breaking down the UI into components, creating a higher order component, using UseEffect, UseMemo, and UseRef for functionality.\n\nMailed the recruiter for feedback as I had just cleared Amazon and had made a decision soon.\nAfter continuous follow-up for 4 days got positive feedback.\nTook another 2 days for the verbal offer and another 4 days for the written offer.\n\nApparently, Apple startes interviewing for a role prior to receiving approval and requires 4 levels of signatures up to the VP level to roll out the offer.\n\nSo, anyone waiting on Apple, just keep following up as they as gonna take their own time!\n\nOffer\n\nI already had an offer from Amazon for SDE 2, and so the baseline was set.\nApple was NOT able to match my Amazon offer at IC3 level as I only had 4.5 YOE and didn't qualify for IC4 :(\n\nBase: 175K\nStock: 33K / year\n**Sign On: **20k\n**Yearly Bonus: **7.5% = ~13k\n\n1st Year TC: 241K\n\nAmazon TC: 280K\nAmazon Innterview - https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6558499/amazon-interview-expereince-l5-seattle-b-vmpa/\n\nI still chose Apple as I didn't want to move to Seattle and deal with Amazon Culture.\n\nIt took me 4"}

However, I believe there may be a more efficient approach.\n\nTechnical Round 1\nProblem:\n\nYou are given an N \u00d7 M grid representing students in a classroom. During an exam, some students attempt to pass a note to each other. The teacher monitors the students, and the probability of getting caught depends on the direction and row in which the note is passed. The detection probabilities for adjacent student passes are as follows:\n\nTop row horizontal pass: 90% chance of getting caught (10% success rate).\n\nVertical pass from top row to second row: 50% chance of getting caught (50% success rate).\n\nSecond row horizontal pass: 45% chance of getting caught (55% success rate).\n\nVertical pass from second row to third row: 25% chance of getting caught (75% success rate).\n\nThird row horizontal pass: 22.5% chance of getting caught (77.5% success rate).\n\n(And so on, with probabilities decreasing further down the rows.)\n\nS -90%    - S   -90% -  S     -90%  - S - - - M  \n|           |           |             |\n50%         50%        50%           50% \n|           |           |             |\nS -45%    - S -45%    - S   -45%    - S - - - M\n|           |           |             |\n25%         25%        25%           25% \n|           |           |             |\nS - 22.5% - S -22.5%  - S   -22.5%  - S - - - M\n|           |           |             |\n12.5%      12.5%      12.5%         12.5%\n|           |           |             |\nS -11.25% - S -11.25% - S   -11.25% - S - - - M\n|           |           |             |\n|           |           |             |\nN           N           N             N\n\nYou are given a specific path (i.e., a sequence of students through which the note is passed). Your task is to compute the overall probability that the note successfully reaches the destination student M without being caught.\n\nThe overall probability is the product of the success rates (i.e., 1 - detection probability) for each step in the path.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: Path: (1,1) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 (2,2) \u2192 (3,2)\nOutput: 0.1 \u00d7 0.5 \u00d7 0.75\n\nInput: Path: (1,1) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 (1,3) \u2192 (2,3) \u2192 (3,3)\nOutput: 0.1 \u00d7 0.1 \u00d7 0.5 \u00d7 0.75\n\nInput: Path: (1,1) \u2192 (2,1) \u2192 (3,1) \u2192 (3,2) \u2192 (3,3)\nOutput: 0.5 \u00d7 0.75 \u00d7 0.775 \u00d7 0.775\n\nFollow-ups:\nEach student has a sneakiness score. The probability of getting caught is now a function of this score:\nSneakiness = 1: Base detection probability remains unchanged\nSneakiness = 0.5: Detection probability increases to the midpoint between the base and twice the base probability.\nSneakiness = 0: Detection probability doubles.\nFind the safest path (i.e., the path with the highest probability of successfully passing the note).\nSolution:\n\nFor the first two problems, I iterated through the given path and computed the probability by multiplying the success probabilities at each step.\nFor the third problem, I proposed using Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm to find the path with the highest probability.\n\nTechnical Round 2\nQuestion 1:\n\nYou are given a list of ordered sublists, where each sublist represents a sequence of integers that must appear in the same relative order in the final merged list. Your task is to merge these sublists into a single ordered list while preserving the relative order of elements within each sublist.\n\nIf multiple valid orderings exist, return any one of them. If merging is impossible due to conflicting constraints, return an empty list.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]\nOutput: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\nInput: [[5, 6, 7], [7, 8], [8, 9, 10]]\nOutput: [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\nInput: [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]\nOutput: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n\nInput: [[1, 2], [3, 1], [2, 4]]\nOutput: [3, 1, 2, 4]\n\nInvalid Case:\nInput: [[1, 2], [3, 1], [2, 4], [4, 3]]\nOutput: [] (Contradiction: [4 \u2192 3] conflicts with [3 \u2192 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 4]).\n\nSolution:\n\nThis is a variation of topological sorting, similar to Leetcode - Course Schedule II.\n\nQuestion 2:\n\nA variation of Leetcode - Parse Lisp Expression where we need to evaluate an expression.\nAn expression can contain numbers and the operations ADD, MULT, or SUB.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: \"MULT(4,ADD(1,SUB(10,3)))\"\nOutput: 32\n\nInput: \"ADD(1,MULT"}

We had a screening call where he asked me about my previous job and my preferred language to and some other basic stuff. Since it was hard to schedule a phone screen in late december my Phonescreen round was scheduled in early January.\n\nPhone screen : Early Jan\n\nI was asked a medium level question based on DP and I gave my inital approach, the interviewer was good with it and asked me code.\nAfter coding the solution I did a dry run with some testcases and edge cases and the interviewer was satified with the solution. Then he asked me if I can optimise it further, we were in the last 10 minutes of the alloted time and I tried out a few things but the time was up.\n\nThe interviewer told me that I was very close to the optimal solution and asked me not to beat myself up on it T_T .\n\nThe question was a variation of this.\n\nAfter this I gave up, thinking there wont be any further rounds but to my surpirse the recruiter reached out to me after two weeks and said I had positive feedback and they want to schedule the onsite rounds.\n\nLate Feb : Onsite rounds , there were 4 onsite rounds in total ,3 were technical and the last one was Googlyness round.\n\nOnsite 1 : I had a really great interviewer and he was genuinely interested and helpful. he asked me a medium level question based on bipirate graphs & trees.\n\nI gave it a few minutes and got the right approach. I coded the solution and then I was asked a simple followup for which I gave my approach and coded it too. we still had 10 minutes left in the interview and then he asked me if I had any questions, he was really cool and we talked about a lot of things and at the end of it he said he's hoping to see me here and wished me luck for further rounds.\n\nI feel like I really did good in this round, took no hints and coded the solution.\n\nOnsite 2: I was given a medium level problem in recursion and I gave the solution for it and then we discussed about the time complexity of the solution and I kinda messed it up but got to the right one after a few minutes, then he asked me a follow up and I gave a DP solution to it and gave it's complexity properly this time.\nI further optimised the space complexity and then he asked me if we can further optimise the solution.\nI tried to find it but was kinda lost , he said he was fine with the O(n) solution but at the end of the interview he said the we can use MCM for the optimised solution.\n\nthis round went well but not as good as my first one since i took a hint.\n\nOnsite 3: The interviewer was late by 15 minutes to the interview since he was stuck in an important meeting. but we started right away, he asked me if I was cool with graphs, i said yes.\n\nI saw the exact same problem being asked in a previous google interview\n\nGiven three source A, B, C and one destination D in a unweighted graph. Determine the number of minimum distinct edges that A, B and C will cover to reach D\n\nI quickly gave my approach, the interviewer asked me go ahead and code it I coded it within a few minutes and told him i was done, the interview was doing his own work in the mean time without actually taking the interview -_- , here I was talking out loud and explaning a the steps while coding the solution.\nI was asked a simple follow up which i was not asked to code, and i gave the solution, he looked at my code and said it looked good and told me my interview was over.\n\nthis round went well too except for the interviewer being too involved in his personal work.\n\nMid march - Googlyness: This round was rescheduled two times and was taken 12 days later.\n\nIt went pretty well, the interviewer was a chill guy and we had a great conversation, I was asked the usual questions from https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/5963463/Googlyness-Frequently-Asked-Questions/\n\n10 days later i.e yesterday I got the call from the recuiter saying that at this moment my feedback was not very positive, and I should try applying after 12 months.\n\nI asked for a more detailed feedback and she just said that I have concentrate more in DSA. I was honestly in denial because i thought I did pretty well in the technical rounds. A more detailed round by round feedback would have helped me out but alas.\n\nTough luck i guess, i really needed this as I'm job hunting since the last 6 months. to anybody reading this.\nI wish you all the best !!!

A and B both are sorted\nApproach: First thought of using a upper/lower bound approach, but interviewer suggested something to do in O(n) so, used a stack, that stores the elements of B and for every ith element of A, pop the elements out whichever are greater than A's ith element, the current stack size would be added to the final answer.\nLater I suggested to go with a two pointer approach.\nFollow-up: Given K dices, with N faces, determine the dice with maximum win.\nSuggested to use a priority_queue where will be storing the dice values and its id (index of dice) and then storing the dice values in hash map (to check for duplicates), and using these values, we can check number of wins for each dice.\n- CONSCLUSION: The interviewer was overall satisfied as I was able to code both of them.\nGot a call from a recruiter within 2 days, but somehow missed it. Got another call after a week for onsite availability\nONSITE 1 (45 min): Given two source A, B and one destination D in a unweighted graph. Determine the number of minimum distinct edges that both A and B will cover to reach D\nInterviewer wasn't interested in the brute force, suggested to come with optimised.\nSuggested some approaches, but interviewer wasn't satisfied. He gave me hints. But I wasn't able to grasp. He wrote a formula, that to find the minimum edges, we can calculate the edges from A,B,D to every ith node and the minimum edges would be A-i+B-i+D-i (A-i => edges from A to i).\nThen I suggested to use BFS to calculate the distance. He then asked me to code. I coded that and interviewer was okay with the code.\n- CONCLUSION: Not sure whether i did okay or very bad, as I took a lot of hints from the interviewer. WHAT'S YOUR VIEW?\nONSITE 2 (45 min): Given a sparse binary array and an api that returns true if there exits atleast single one between the (i,j) i.e query(i,j) (query=> API) will return true if there is a single one between i and j. Determine the positions of 1 in the array.\nGot nervous as the interview was a little strict, took 10 mins to realise that its a binary search problem. Suggested to use that approach and use the api for query(low,mid) and query(mid+1,high) and then recurse through the function if left is true and/or right is true.\nMessed up at the Time complexity. The interviewer wasn't giving me time and at first I said its log(n), but then I realised, that if both left and right are true, then we will recurse through both.\nAfter many discussion, Interviewer said that it would be KlogN, K=> number of Ones. I realised, that but the interviewer confused me a lot and I was only getting nervous\n- CONCLUSION: Don't know how I did. WHAT'S YOUR VIEW?\nONSITE 3 (45 min): Given M sequence of numbers, create one sequence where every element follows the same order as present in every sequence. If its not possible to create a unique sequence, return {}\nWas thinking of approaches, but then the interviewer hinted that its something related to dependency. Then i realised its topological sorting question. I coded my solution and the interviewer was satisfied.\nQ2: Given an array of start time for N processes that have the same duration of completion. Given M CPUs, determine the minimum time when all processes will be completed.\nSuggested an binary search approach, to determine the lower bound for the process start time when no CPU is available. This number will tell us when the process would start. BUT I messed up here, I didn't realise that, if the lower bound is not zero (index) then the index CPUs would be freed up by then, and the process would start from its expected start time\nDidn't got much time to discuss, but coded the solution in 5-8 minutes, and then later realised my mistake ;-)\n- CONCLUSION: I think here i did better than onsite 1 and 2. But would like to know your view\nGOOGLINESS: Went okayish, the interviwer was very friendly however.\n\nIts been almost 2 weeks, and I haven't heard any feedback from the Recruiter yet. Can anyone suggest what should I do in this case?"}

Upon reaching the destination, I would return the minimum health required.\n\nTime Complexity: (E+V)LogV\ufffc\n\nInterviewer\u2019s Feedback:\n\nThe interviewer pointed out potential inefficiencies in my approach, though I wasn\u2019t fully convinced initially.

Binary Search on health:\n\u2022 For a given mid health, check if it\u2019s possible to reach the destination using only connections that allow traversal within this limit.\n\u2022 This check is done using graph traversal (BFS/DFS).\n3. Adjust Search Space: Update the range based on whether reaching the destination was possible.\n\nTime Complexity: (E+V)LogS\ufffc\ufffc, where S is the maximum constraint value.\n\nOutcome:\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn\u2019t complete my implementation within the 45-minute timeframe, and I might receive a \u201cNo Hire\u201d or \u201cLean Hire\u201d decision.\n\nReflection:\n\nI\u2019m still unsure why my initial approach wouldn\u2019t work efficiently, especially since S (the constraint range) was mentioned to be large.

The result should be a list of non-overlapping intervals in sorted order while preserving the correct interval inclusion/exclusion format.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n a = [[2.5, 7.5), (9.0, 10.4]]  \r\n b = [(4.3, 9.3), [9.5, 11.0)]  \n\nOutput:\n\n[[2.5, 4.3], [9.3, 9.5)]  \n\nExplanation:\n\nThe first interval [2.5, 7.5) from a overlaps with (4.3, 9.3), so the remaining non-overlapping part is [2.5, 4.3].\nThe second interval (9.0, 10.4] from a overlaps with [9.3, 9.3] (trivial) and [9.5, 11.0). The remaining non-overlapping part is [9.3, 9.5).\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n a = [(1.0, 5.0)]  \r\n b = [[2.0, 3.0), (4.0, 6.0)]  \n\nOutput:\n\n[(1.0, 2.0), [3.0, 4.0]]\nConstraints:\n1 \u2264 len(a), len(b) \u2264 10^4\na[i] = [start, end], [start, end), (start, end], or (start, end) where 0 \u2264 start < end \u2264 10^9\nb[i] = [start, end], [start, end), (start, end], or (start, end) where 0 \u2264 start < end \u2264 10^9\na and b contain non-overlapping intervals within themselves and are sorted in increasing order by start.\nThe output must also be a list of non-overlapping intervals in increasing order, preserving the correct inclusion/exclusion format.\nFollow-Up:\nWhat is given lists a and b were not sorted and also if they were overlapping?

Being someone who has always aspired to work at FAANG, I promptly responded with my updated CV and scheduled a quick call. The recruiter call, held over Google Meet, lasted about 20 minutes. After a brief introduction, they walked through my resume, discussing my full-time experience and frontend-heavy skill set.

However, on November 28, I received an email from a recruiter expressing interest in my profile. After responding, I got a call from the recruiter, who explained the hiring process and sent me an invitation for a prep session. They also asked me to provide available time slots for the Technical Phone Screen (TPS). Initially, I requested about a month to prepare and suggested slots for the first week of January. However, the recruiter encouraged me to choose an earlier date due to the upcoming holiday season.\n\nTPS [17/12/2024]\n\nThe interviewer introduced himself and quickly proceeded with the question.\n\nQuestion 1:\n\nThere is an array of size n.

I also outlined the expected time and space complexity of the brute force and the optimal approach. The interviewer then asked me to code the optimal solution. After coding, I dry-ran the implementation using a few edge cases and the given example. The interviewer seemed satisfied, though the dry run took some time due to calculations.\n\nWith limited time remaining, the interviewer proceeded with a follow-up question. I explained my approach, and he appeared satisfied but did not ask me to code. Towards the end, I asked a few questions about Google's work culture, and the interview concluded.\n\nWithin two hours, I was informed that the feedback was positive, and I was asked to share my availability for onsite rounds.\n\nI shared my available time slots for the onsite interviews and took about a month to prepare.\n\nOS1 [09/01/2025]\n\nThe interviewer briefly introduced himself and asked for a quick introduction from me.

Return the number of cars in the garage at any given time.\n\nFollow up:\n\nThe question was turned into a garage system design question, with constraints like capacity of the garage, day checks and parking fee calculation\n\nQuestion 2:\n\nYou are given multiple (x,y) coordinates. For any point give the number of rectangles covering the point.\nSimilar Question: Count Number of Rectangles Containing Each Point - LeetCode [Difference: Rectangle didn\u2019t have one corner in the origin]\n\nI was able to solve the first question along with its follow-up, but I struggled with the second question. I proposed an approach, but the interviewer didn\u2019t seem fully convinced. I tried hard to refine my solution, but despite my efforts, the interviewer simply nodded without indicating much progress. Eventually, I admitted that I couldn\u2019t come up with a better approach. The interviewer was very kind and reassured me, saying that even if I spent the next 10 minutes finding a solution, we wouldn\u2019t have enough time to code it. He quickly presented another question, and I took a moment to regain my composure and focus, determined to give my best effort in solving it.\n\nQuestion 3:\n\nThis question was related to logs of a telephone company. He asked me to create two functions, one for registering each log and one to find the most talkative person at any timestamp (whenever the function is invoked)\n\nI asked for a few clarifying questions related to the format of the logs and quickly came up and coded the optimal solution and the interviewer seemed satisfied.\n\nSelf Rating: Lean Hire\n\nOS2 [10/01/2025]\n\nThe interviewer introduced himself and proceeded with the questions.\n\nQuestion 1:\n\nSimilar to: Minimum Area Rectangle - LeetCode [Replace Minimum with Maximum]\nFollow Up:\nThe rectangles formed are not parallel to the axis.\n\nQuestion 2:\n\nThere are multiple centres which communicate with each other. There are two-way communication channels between the centres. There is a list of corrupted stations.\nGiven the communication channels, source and destination nodes, determine if you can reach the destination node without traversing through any of the corrupted stations.\n\nI successfully solved both questions optimally, explained my approaches along with their time complexities, and dry-ran the solutions using edge cases and a few example test cases.

It has been a rollercoaster of emotions, filled with excitement, nervousness, and a lot of self-reflection.\n\nIt all started when a recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn. I felt incredibly lucky to get this opportunity, and I knew I had to give it my all.\n\nThe Beginning\n\nHad my first conversation with the recruiter on 11th Nov 2024, and soon after, my phone screen was scheduled for 13th Dec 2024.\n\n13th Dec 2024 \u2013 Phone Screen\n\nI was given a graph problem and, with a few hints, managed to crack the optimal solution. I was so pumped when I got the call the very next day saying that I cleared it! My onsites were going to be scheduled next.\n\nBut then... ghosting. Weeks went by without any updates. The uncertainty was tough, but finally, my onsite interviews were set for the third week of Feb 2025.\n\nBeing a morning person, I requested morning slots on consecutive days. The final schedule was:\n\n17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th Feb 2025.\nPreparation Mode ON\n\nI gave everything I had to make this count. Read 250+ interview experiences, took 20+ mock interviews, and connected with amazing people through Leetcode and LinkedIn. The support I received was heartwarming, and it kept me in a really good state of mind going into the onsites.\n\n14th Feb 2025 \u2013 Mock Interview\n\nI wanted a mock interview before my onsites and thus requested the recruiter for the same. I got my mock scheduled on 14th Feb 2025 in the evening. The interviewer was from London, a Senior Software Engineer with 6 YOE at Google.\n\nI was asked a pretty standard BFS question with three follow-ups. Graphs are one of my stronger areas, so I solved the first question pretty quickly. Then, the interviewer kept asking follow-ups, and I was able to explain and code all of them one by one. This went really well, and the interviewer even praised me for my speed and understanding of the question.\n\nSelf-rating: Strong hire.\n\nThis was the best thing that could have happened before my onsites. It gave me a huge confidence boost. All my interviewers for the onsites were Indian, and they were very friendly and supportive.\n\nThe Onsite Experience\n17th Feb 2025 \u2013 First Onsite (DSA Round)\nGot a LeetCode Hard problem on streams.\nCame up with the optimal solution, and the interviewer seemed satisfied.\nBut\u2026 I left a conditional bug in the code. Even after a hint, I couldn\u2019t fix it. That moment still haunts me.\nI really thought this could have been a strong hire, but that bug might have cost me.\nSelf-rating: Hire.\n\n18th Feb\u2019s interview got rescheduled to 21st Feb.\n\n19th Feb 2025 \u2013 Second Onsite (DSA Round)\nGot a LeetCode Medium problem based on cyclic sort.\nSolved the better approach without hints, and with a couple of hints, I cracked the optimal one.\nForgot the syntax for a custom comparator in a priority queue (CPP being my go-to language). That might have left a bad impression.\nAgain, thought this could have been a strong hire, but those minor slip-ups made me doubt.\nSelf-rating: Hire.\nRescheduling Woes\n20th Feb \u2013 Googliness round got rescheduled to 3rd March.\n21st Feb \u2013 Last DSA round was cancelled because the panel didn\u2019t join (moved to 4th March).\n\nAt this point, I was a mix of frustration and nervousness. These delays meant I had to keep my momentum going for another two weeks!\n\n3rd March 2025 \u2013 Googliness & Leadership Round\nThe interviewer was super chill. That helped calm my nerves.\nBeing my first-ever culture-fit round, I was a bit nervous initially.\nStruggled to frame my answers properly, but the interviewer encouraged me to relax and think through my responses.\nWe wrapped up early and had a great chat about life at Google.\nSelf-rating: Hire.\n4th March 2025 \u2013 Final Onsite (DSA Round)\nThis was the big one. I was SO excited and determined to get a strong hire.\nGot a problem: Find the sum of all subarrays where the difference is 1 or -1.\nImmediately recognized it was a DP problem.\nBUT\u2026 I messed up.\nInstead of starting with brute force, I zoned out and jumped straight into trying to derive a mathematical formula.\nWasted 20 minutes trying to crack the formula.\nThe interviewer gave me no hints (which meant they expected me to figure it out).\nWith only 10 minutes left, I was told to at least code the brute force approach.\nBarely managed to complete it. Didn\u2019t even get time to debug.\nCompletely shattered.\nThe interviewer even mentioned that I should work on handling pressure better.\nIf I had just played it safe, started from brute force, and then optimized, I might have at least gotten a Lean Hire instead of what I feared was a No Hire.\nSelf-rating: Lean No Hire.\nThe Aftermath\n\nWithin 3 hours of my last onsite, I got a call from the recruiter.\n\nI missed it.\n\nHad to wait two long days before we could finally connect. The anticipation was brutal.\n\nWhen I finally got the call, the recruiter told me:\n\nI did really well in the Googliness round.\nMy DSA performance could have been better.\nI "}

This round focused on:\nAn LLD problem: I had to design a voting poll system and display the results in charts as percentages.\nAlthough I was able to complete the logic for the voting poll, I got stuck resolving an error and lost around 10-15 minutes. Due to time constraints, I couldn\u2019t implement the charts fully but managed to display the results in numbers.\nFinal Round (Director): I was called for a final interview with the director on the following day.

Hence, one additional DSA round was scheduled.\n\nInterviewer was very friendly and supportive.\n\nProblem 1: Give NxN matrix containing black holes find the shorted path from top-left to bottom-right\n\nSolved it using BFS\nFound edge cases while coding\n\nProblem 2: Similar to https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix-ii/\n\nSolved using Binary Search + Two Pointers Approach.\nDiscussed edge cases and optimizations.\nAble to dry run of code.\n\nVerdict: Strong Hire\n\nHiring Committee & Team Matching\n\nAfter the onsite rounds, the recruiter informed me that my performance was positive in all rounds and my profile would be forwarded to the Hiring Committee.\n\nHiring Committee took around 2 weeks to review the feedback and gave a Final Hire Decision.\n\nPost that, the Team Matching Process started, where I was connected with Google Ads team, HM joined the interview and asked me about my background, discussed about tech stack, my preference of\nwork etc etc - I enjoyed the conversation.\n\nFinal Result\n\nAfter 1 week, I received the Offer Letter from Google\n\nTill the offer came I've joined Microsoft as an SDE2.
